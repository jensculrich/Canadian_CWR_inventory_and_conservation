Per Hedrick (see citation): ""...vigorous form of hte riparia type with pubescent young growth, differing from the typical Riparia in having more, less lobed leaves and more incised teeth. Its leaves are frequently pubescent beneath. Another form with dentate margin of leaf has been known under the name of Nuevo Mexicana or Novo Mexicana. The references to these two forms are inextricably confused. Engelmann refers to this grape which he says he found growing in the botanic garden of Berlin under the name of Vitis solonis. After careful investigation he decided that htis name was a corruption of Vitis longii, or Long's grape, which had been grought from the headwaters of the Arkansas river by Major Long's expedition in to that then unknown country in the early part of the last century. Many botanists consider this a hybrid of two or more other species, Riparia, Rupestris, Candicans and Cordifolia being offered as probable parents. Its habitat is northern Texas 'westard into New Mexico, eastward into Oklahoma and northward into Kansas and southeastern Colorado.' Vitis longii was first described by Prince in 1830. The fruit is small and sour and it appears to be of no horticultural promise.""",1013548,DVIT 1403,Vitis,,,Vitis acerifolia,Vitis acerifolia

Features 5-petaled, showy, slightly fragrant, white flowers in drooping clusters (racemes) which appear before the leaves emerge in early spring. Finely toothed, obovate, bluish green leaves (2-5' long) change to brilliant orange-red in autumn (hence the cultivar name). Flowers give way to small, round green berries which turn red and finally mature to a dark purplish black in early summer. Edible berries are sweet, resembling blueberries in size and color, and are often used in jams, jellies and pies. Amelanchiers are also often commonly called Juneberries. Amelanchier x grandiflora is a cross between A arborea and A. laevis.It will reach 20 to 25 feet at maturit. white Flowers, edible fruits, clean summer foliage, persistent leaves and brilliant red fall color are notable attributes. Light gray bark, attractive in winter, grows faster and will produe a 6 to 8 foot high heavily branched plant from an 18 to 24 inch liner in 3 years. Hardy to -35F.

The native distribution of C. glabra includes mostly the eastern half of the U.S., with northern limits stretching into southern Michigan with western limits touching the eastern Iowa border.  Pecans, C. illinoinensis, are economically important due to their utilization via nut production for human consumption, while the true hickories are extremely valuable for wildlife, wood working, and of course providing that hickory-smoke flavor to meats.  C. glabra meats are not known for being consumed via humans, but are attractive to various birds and animals.  Their presence is likely lacking in the human diet due to the difficulty in extracting the meats.  Notable ornamental characteristics include newly emerging foliage that resembles a flower, and yellow/brown fall color.  Foliage is typically very clean with little to no foliar diseases.  Carya are not a commonly planted species via the nursery trade largely due to the presence of an extensive taproot system that makes transplanting difficult.  While the average homeowner may claim nuts in the landscape are an undesirable trait or a nuisance, attention should be turned to the benefits of nuts in the landscape.  Generally it is difficult to find nuts on the ground as wildlife quickly eat and gather them.  Hickories tend to be labeled as slow growing, which is definitely not true.  Carya are only slow growing during the first few years of establishment as growth is focused on root growth.  Shortly after establishment, growth on a properly planted Carya can be considered extremely vigorous with annual growth easily surpassing two to three feet per year.  All Carya are noted for being extremely drought tolerant, while C. illinoinensis, C. cordiformis, C. acquatica, and C. laciniosa are also flood tolerant. This species is adapted to extremely dry soils and should not be planted in wet soils.",1940349,Ames 33356,Carya,,,Carya glabra,Carya glabra

The rootstock has survived almost 20 years of culling from an original pool of 150, which were originated from planting and evaluating nearly 25,000 seedlings during the early years of the project. It consistently rank at the top for nut production, an unusual trait because yields generally vary from year to year. Dundee forms smooth union when topworked with the Ennis cultivar. It has light colored, silvery bark that is quite smooth. It has excellent vigor as observed from trees in nursery to trees nearly 20 years old.

Harvest is earlier than 'Barcelona,' and the nuts have fewer defects. Tree growth habit: 'Lewis' is a 'grower-friendly' tree, with a good balance between vegetative and reproductive growth and can be managed much like a 'Barcelona.' Tree size is 75% of 'Barcelona' as measured by the trunk cross sectional area. Flowering characteristics: Female flowers bloom at the same time as 'Barcelona.' The incompatibility alleles are S3 S8. The recommended pollinizers are 'Tonda di Giffoni' and 'Hall's Giant.' Yield and yield efficiency: 'Lewis' has out-yielded 'Barcelona' in the first 4 bearing years and yields were similar in 1997. 'Lewis' is a more efficient nut producer than 'Barcelona' (i.e. yields are greater and tree size is smaller). More of the tree's resources are used to produce nuts and less to develop leaves and wood. Harvest time: Nut clusters contain 3-4 nuts. Nuts are freehusking and ready to harvest 5-7 days earlier than 'Barcelona.' Nut and kernel quality: 'Lewis' nuts are smaller than 'Barcelona.' Only 17% of the nuts had defects in 1997, compared to 28 percent for 'Barcelona.' Most defects in 'Lewis' are shriveled, poorl filled, or moldy nuts. In 1997, only I% of the nuts were blanks, 'Barcelona' had 8%. Kernel is 4-5% greater than 'Barcelona.' Raw kernels have very little fiber. Kernels blanch slightly better than 'Barcelona' and have good flavor and texture. Propagation: 'Lewis' is easy to propagate by the 'tie-off' method. Layers are well rooted and vigorous. Pest tolerance: A major strength is its tolerance to eastern filbert blight. Its tolerance to the pathogen is better than 'Willamette' and 'Hall' Giant.' Big bud mite tolerance is comparable to 'Casina.'",1544654,PI 617210,Corylus,,,Corylus avellana,Corylus avellana

The Oregon Agricultural Experiment Station announces the release of a new hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) cultivar. 'Clark' has smaller trees, higher yield efficiency, higher percent kernel, and kernels that are more easily blanched than the standard 'Barcelona'. The nuts fall free of the husk at maturity and can be mechanically harvested about 8 days earlier than 'Barcelona'. 'Clark', tested as OSU 276.142, resulted from a cross of 'Tombul Ghiaghli' from Greece with'Willamette' made in 1982. Light roasting and rubbing removes most of the pellicle of 'Clark' kernels, making them suitable for sale on the blanched kernel market. 'Clark' has a higher frequency of moldy kernels than 'Barcelona' but fewer than 'Willamette'. 'Clark' has a high level of quantitative resistance to eastern filbert blight caused by Anisogramma anomala (Peck) E. Muller, as determined by measuring the cankers which developed after exposure of potted trees under structures topped with diseased wood. Although not immune to eastern filbert blight, growers should be able to manage orchards of 'Clark' in the presence of the disease. Resistance to big bud mite (primarily Phyloplus avellanae Nal.) is also good. 'Clark' has incompatibility alleles S3 and S8. Both alleles are expressed in the stigmas and pollen. Female anthesis is very late, even later than 'Ennis'. Therefore, very late-shedding pollinizers are needed. 'Hall's Giant' is recommended for the earliest females to emerge.Very late-shedding OSU selections are recommended as pollinizers for the peak of female anthesis. 'Clark' is being released as a public variety and may be propagated without restriction. A list of nurseries propagating trees of 'Clark' may be obtained from the industry web site (www.oregonhazelnuts.org) or S. A.

OSU 296.082 is a seedling from a cross of OSU 17.068 (= Barcelona x Tombul Ghiaghli) x Willamette, and VR 8-32 is from a cross of the Sicilian cultivar Montebello x Gassaway. Compared to Barcelona, Yamhill is a smaller tree with higher nut yields per tree and a much higher yield efficiency. Nuts of Yamhill are smaller (2.3 g) than those of Barcelona (3.8 g) and have a higher percent kernel (49% vs 43%). Nuts fall free of the husk at maturity and can be mechanically harvested about 10 days earlier than Barcelona. The kernels fill the nuts well even with a heavy crop. Raw kernels are attractive, having little fiber on their light brown pellicles. Blanching ratings are equal to Barcelona, indicating that about half ot the pellicle is removed by dry heat. Kernel quality is suitable for many end uses, and it competitive with kernels imported from Turkey. 'Yamhill' has complete resistance to eastern filbert blight conferred by a dominant allele from 'Gasaway', and has incompatibility alleles S8 and S26.

Nuts of 'Yamhill' are smaller (2.3 g) than those of 'Barcelona' (3.8 g) and have a higher percent kernel (49% vs. 43%).  The nuts fall free of the husk at maturity and can be mechanically harvested 10 to 15 days earlier than 'Barcelona'.  The kernels fill the nuts well even with a heavy crop.  Raw kernels are attractive, having little fiber on their light brown pellicles.  Blanching ratings are equal to 'Barcelona', indicating that about half of the pellicle is removed by dry heat.  Kernel quality is suitable for many end uses, and is competitive with kernels imported from Turkey.  The frequency of blanks, poorly filled nuts, and doubles is less than for 'Barcelona'.  'Yamhill' has a low frequency of moldy kernels, which was especially striking in 2005 when mold was a problem on 'Lewis' and many other genotypes.  'Yamhill' has complete resistance to eastern filbert blight, conferred by a dominant allele from 'Gasaway'.  'Yamhill' has incompatibility alleles S8 and S26.  Both alleles are expressed in the stigmas, but only S8 is expressed in the pollen.  Pollen shed and female receptivity occur early in the season, about with 'Barcelona'.  Pollinizers that shed pollen in early midseason are recommended.  We recommend one-third each of 'Gamma' (S2 S10) and 'Santiam' (S3 S15) which shed pollen early in the season and have a short shedding time.  For the remaining third, a mixture of later-shedding types is recommended, of which several are suitable:  'Delta' (S1 S15), 'Epsilon' (S1 S4), 'Zeta' (S1 S1) and OSU 703.007 (S1 S3).  All four have complete resistance to eastern filbert blight.",1616882,PI 637862,Corylus,,,Corylus avellana,Corylus avellana

Mehlenbacher from Oregon State University with quantitative resistance to Eastern Filbert Blight (EFB). Sacajawea is the result of a cross of OSU 43.091 x Sant Pere made in 1990 by Shawn A. Mehlenbacher and David C. Smith. 'Sant Pere', a minor cultivar from Tarragona (Spain) with very early nut maturity, was described by Tasias-Valls (1975). We believe that OSU 43.091 resulted from self-pollination of Montebello, which is partially self-compatible (Mehlenbacher and Smith, 1991). Alternatively, the pollen parent of OSU 43.091 might be an unknown cultivar or OSU selection. `Montebello', a Sicilian cultivar, was described by Manzo and Tamponi (1982) and is grown under many synonyms, including Nocchione, Nostrale, Comune di Sicilia, Siciliana, and `Santa Maria del Gesu.   Hybrid seeds from the cross OSU 43.091 x Sant Pere were harvested in Aug. 1990, stratified, and the resulting seedlings grown in the greenhouse during the summer of 1991. In Oct. 1991, 135 seedlings from this cross were planted in the field. The location designation OSU 540.130 for Sacajawea indicates the row and tree within the row of the original seedling. A few nuts were first observed on the original seedling in Sept. 1994 but were not harvested. Nuts were harvested and evaluated in each of the next 4 years. The selected tree was propagated by tieoff layerage of the suckers in the summer of 1997. The resulting rooted layers were lined out in a nursery row in 1998 and used to plant a replicated yield trial in the spring of 1999 at the Smith Horticulture Research Farm in Corvallis. Four trees of each genotype were planted in a randomized complete block design with a single tree of each genotype in each block. Oregon's leading cultivar, `Barcelona', and the recently released `Lewis and `Clark were included as checks. Nuts were harvested and evaluated annually for 5 years (2001 to 2005). The name was chosen to honor the Shoshone woman who accompanied Meriwether Lewis and William Clark and their Corps of Discovery to the Oregon Territory. They spent the winter of 1805 to 1806 near Astoria, OR.   Sacajawea is a new hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) cultivar for the kernel market. It combines a high level of quantitative resistance to eastern filbert blight caused by the fungus Anisogramma anomala (Peck) E. Muller with excellent kernel quality and acceptable nut yields. Compared with Oregon's leading cultivar, Barcelona, Sacajawea has slightly smaller trees, slightly higher nut yield efficiency, earlier nut maturity, higher percentage of kernel (the ratio of kernel to nut weight), and better pellicle removal ratings. The excellent kernel quality is comparable to the best Italian cultivars.",1699814,PI 654984,Corylus,,,Corylus avellana,Corylus avellana

Potential new cultivar expected to be released in 2009. Well suited to the in-shell market, it combines high yield, large nut size and a vigorous tree. Nut maturity is with 'Barcelona' or up to three days later. Requires a late-shedding polinizer. The Oregon Agricultural Experiment Station announces the release of a new hazelnut (Corylus avellana L.) cultivar 'Jefferson' for th in-shell market with high nut yields, attractive nuts and kernels, good kernel quality, resistance to bud mite (primarily Phytoptus avellanae Nal.), and complete resistance to eastern filbert blight caused by Anisogramma anomala (Peck) E. M ller. 'Jefferson' (OSU 703.007) resulted from a cross of OSU 252.146 x OSU 414.062 made in 1993. OSU 252.146 is a seedling from a cross of OSU 41.083 (= 'Montebello' x 'Compton') x OSU 17.028 (= 'Barcelona' x 'Tombul Ghiaghli'), and OSU 414.062 is from a cross of OSU 23.017 (= 'Barcelona' x 'Extra Ghiaghli') x VR 11-27 (= 'Montebello' x 'Gasaway'). Compared to the standard 'Barcelona', 'Jefferson' has smaller trees, higher nut yields per tree, and higher nut yield efficiency. Nuts of 'Jefferson' are large (3.2-4.2 g) and similar in size to 'Barcelona' (3.8 g) and have a slightly higher percent kernel (45% vs. 43%). About 80% of the nuts fall free of the husk at maturity and can be mechanically harvested with 'Barcelona' or up to 3 days later. The kernels fill the nuts well, which is unusual for a large nut. Raw kernels have a moderate to heavy amount of fiber on their pellicles, similar to 'Barcelona'. Blanching ratings are slightly better than 'Barcelona', indicating that slightly more than half of the pellicle is removed by dry heat. Kernel quality is suitable for many end uses, although they are larger than the size desired by most chocolate makers and bakers. The frequency of blanks, poorly filled nuts, and double is less than for 'Barcelona'. 'Jefferson' has a low frequency of moldy kernels, which was especially striking in 2005 when mold was a problem on 'Lewis' and many other genotypes. 'Jefferson' has more kernels with black tips than 'Barcelona', which i a reflection of the occasional hairline splits where the two halves of the shell join at the apex. 'Jefferson' has complete resistance to eastern filbert blight, conferred by a dominant allele from 'Gasaway'. 'Jefferson' appears to be susceptible to bacterial blight, as is 'Barcelona'. Copper sprays are recommended for control of bacterial blight.  'Jefferson' has incompatibility alleles S1 and S3, the same as 'Willamette'. Both alleles are expressed in the stigmas, but only S3 is expressed in the pollen. Pollen is shed in mid-season, but female receptivity is very late. Pollinizers that shed pollen very late are recommended. We recommend one-third of 'Eta' (S11 S26) and two-thirds 'Theta' (S5 S15). 'Yamhill' pollen is effective on early-emerging females of 'Jefferson', so planting orchards of two cultivars, alternating 'Jefferson' and 'Yamhill' at double density, is also an option.  'Jefferson' is being released as a public cultivar and may be propagated fo sale in the United States without restriction. A list of nurseries and micropropagators is available from S. A. Mehlenbacher, Department of Horticulture, 4017 Agricultural and Life Sciences Building, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR 97331-7304. Small quantities of scion wood may be obtained from the same address. Legal protection for 'Jefferson' will be sought in Chile, and a licensing agreement pursued with a micropropagator and a nursery.

Plant: superior vigor, somewhat more so than Missionary, runners produced freely, flower perfect, resistant to leaf spot, leaf scorch, well adapted to hill culture, adapted to southern states, very productive, grown on a wide range of soil types.Brooks and Olmo, 1972.This variety was originated by G. M. Darrow, of the U.S. Department of Agriculture as a cross of Missionary X Howard 17, made in 1923 and selected in 1925. It was sent out for trial in the spring of 1927 and later that year tests by Lathrop of the National Preservers Association indicated that it was superior for preserving. In 1928, in tests by Dearing at the North Carolina Department of Agriculture Station at Willard, N.C., it was considered to be outstanding as a shipping variety for the South and it was introduced through that Station and cooperating nurseries in 1929. Its resistance to leaf spot and leaf scorch, its tolerance to virus diseases, its attractive scarlet fruit, its firmness fo shipping, its superiority for preserving, and its greater productiveness as compared with Klondike, led to a quick replacement of Klondike by Blakemore except in southern Louisiana and in Florida. It replaced Missionary in Virginia and North Carolina. Blakemore was grown as far north as southern New Jersey, but has since been replaced there by newer varieties, first by Sparkle and then Jerseybelle, and in Maryland and Virginia by Pocahontas, Dixieland, Earlidawn, and red stele-resistant varieties.When Blakemore was selected only 64 seedlings of the cross were grown. One other selection of the same progeny was named the Bellmar. It was larger, less acid, less firm, slightly deeper red, and several days later than Blakemore. It did not succeed, partly because it was not as firm and partly because virus diseases made it less productive under many conditions. Later large numbers of seedlings of the same cross were grown and the Suwannee was named for its very high dessert quality, which is perhaps the best in the United states. It is less tolerant of virus, however, and has nearly disappeared. A stock free of virus has been obtained by Dr. John McGrew.The limiting characters of Blakemore are its relatively smal size and its sporting to yellow plants. 'June yellows' or 'variegation', which was first noted in 1933 and rapidly increased in all sections of the United States. At first it seemed that the variety might be lost, but non-yellowing stocks were selected in several places and some of these proved relatively stable. Though the condition is inherited, research in North Carolina indicates that it is possible to use Blakemore in breeding non-yellowing varieties.Blakemore has been used extensively in breeding and is in the ancestry of Northwest, Headliner, Dixieland, Pocahontas, Albritton, Massey, Earlidawn, Surecrop, Armore, Dabreak, Silets, Goldsmith, Klonmore and others.Blakemore was bred by George M. Darrow of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, introduced in 1929. From about 1937 to 1961 this was the most planted varieity in the United States because of its early ripening, very firm, bright red, good shipping berries, good for freezing and preserving, high in pectin. Plants are virus-tolerant, resistant to leaf spot, leaf scorch, and Verticillium wilt. Limitations: its berries are too small, too acid for best dessert flavor, and the plants sport tp varigation.G.

Darrow, of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, from a cross made in 1923, was selected in 1925 and introduced in 1933. Its parentage is probably Etters 450 x Howard 17 (Premier) or Howard Supreme x Etters 450 (Darrow, 1962). It is notable as one of the finest flavored of all strawberries. It does not keep its flavor so well as Suwannee in cool, cloudy, or in hot, windy weather. Fairfax is resistant to leaf diseases but susceptible to red stele root disease and to virus diseases and to fasciation in southern states. Fairfax is a good but not excessive plant marker, its flowers produce the most pollen of any; the berries are good sized, deep red in color, firm fleshed, and the least acid of common varieities. Since virus-free stocks of Fairfax have become available, it is being grown widely.Fairfax has proved to be a good parent and Grenadier (of Canada), Redstar, Sparkle and possibly Kogyoku of Japan (24 in all) have Fairfax as one parent while Cavalier, Guardsman, and Redcoat of Canada, Redguantlet and Talisman of Great Britain, and Arapahoe, Ogallala, Red Rich, and Surecrop are among 38 others having Fairfax in the ancestry (Darrow, 1962). Fairfax transmits excellent dessert quality and freedom from leaf spot. Its limitations are that the berries turn purplish when over-ripe, it is not acid enough for a good freezing variety, and its excellent flavor does not develop under some weather conditions. Its decendants are being used more as parent varieities.G. Darrow. 1966. The Strawberry. p. 152.George M.

PI 551485,'Darrow',Fragaria ×ananassa Duchesne ex Rozier,"Maryland, United States",COR,,Add to cart,1983,DEVELOPED,1974,,,,,CULTIVAR,"'Darrow' is a new strawberry variety released by the U. S. Department of Agriculture and the Maryland Agricultural Experiment Station in January 1974 from the cooperative strawberry breeding program. 'Darrow', tested as MdUS 3773, originated from a cross between MdUS 2713, a very early-ripening selection, and MdUS 2787, a midseason selection made in 1963 by the senior author. Some historic parentage is involved in the early breeding of 'Darrow' dating to 1938 when Scotland BK46 from Mr. Robert Reid of Ayr, Scotland, was first crossed with 'Fairfax' (Fig. 1). The seedlings from which 'Darrow' was selected were grown at Salisbury, Maryland, in 1964 and the selection was made during fruiting in the spring of 1965 by D. H. Scott, I. C. Haut, and A. D. Draper.'Darrow' ripens 1 to 2 days later than 'Earlidawn' and 'Midland'. Its berries are medium-large and have firm, glossy surfaces of deep red color (Fig. 2). The flesh is very firm and has a uniform red color that is satisfactory for frozen pack. The flavor is good. Primary berries may be rough at times, but secondary and later berries have a symmetrical conic shape. The fruit has been rough and unattractive in Arkansas and North Carolina.Plants of 'Darrow' are productive in Maryland, at New Brunswick, New Jersey, and at Columbia, Missouri. They have not been so productive at Wooster, Ohio, Sodus, Michigan, and Lafayette, Indiana. At two locations in Maryland 'Darrow' has outyielded 'Surecrop' in six of the seven compari-sons. In 1973, at Beltsville, 'Darrow' and 'Raritan' were equal in yield (Table 1). 'Raritan' is consistently a top-yielding variety at Beltsville. The plants are vigorous, but they do not produce as many runner plants as 'Guardian', 'Sunrise', 'Surecrop', and other vigorous varieties. The plants are resistant to at least 5 races of the red stele fungus, Phytophthora fra-gariae Hickman. They are partially resistant to verticillium wilt, with a disease index of 38 compared with 94 for 'Dixieland' (very susceptible) and 12 for 'Guardian' (very resistant). 'Darrow' leaves are moderately re-sistant to leaf scorch, powdery mil-dew, and leaf spot. 'Darrow' is the earliest ripening of the red stele re-sistant varieties.The variety is named for Dr. George M. Darrow, renowned former head of small fruit investigations of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, who has devoted much of his life to improve-ment of the strawberry.Donald H. Scott, I. C. Haut and A. D.

Cloud, a railroad shipping agent of Independence, Louisiana, who knew that a better shipping variety was needed and bred one. Its parentage was given by Mr. Cloud as Pickerproof x Hoffman. Very soon it became the standard variety of the entire southern United States, excepting the central and southern Florida areas; until the introduction of Blakemore. The Blakemore, a still firmer variety, replaced it in most of the South in the 1930's, while Klonmore replaced it in Louisiana. It is now grown only in the plateau region near Irapuato, Mexico, for freezing. Klondike possessed many of the characteristics of  Wilson - it was acid, deep red, of medium size, produced runners freely, and withstood neglect. It also was moderately productive and withstood the heat of southern summers. It was liked for freezing, because of its rich red color and its acidity. Its chief limitations were its susceptibility to leaf scorch and leaf spot, its medium size and lack of firmness. Blakemore replaced it because of its firmer, brighter fruits and Klonmore because of its resistance to leaf spot.Klondike is in the parentage of Klonmore, Headliner, and Dabreak, varieties that replaced it in the Louisiana region.George M.

E. Kuhns, a strawberry grower of Cliffwood, New Jersey, which is situated not far from the New Jersey Agriculutral Experiment Station at New Brunswick, New Jersey. Mr. Kuhns was growing Glen Mary, Chesapeake, and Late Stevens about the time be obtained the Aberdeen and decided to introduce it. He was in the habit of testing many new varieities, of making crosses, and growing seedlings of those that interested him without keeping a record of their ancestry. He regularly had a field of several hundred seedlings under test. As early as 1910 he had promising varieties, some of which he introduced. A letter from his son, W.W. Kuhns, in 1963 states that the elder Mr. Kuhns had said that a cross with the vigor of Late Stevens and quality of Chesapeake would be a great berry. The son also said that if a seedling was from these two it had the vigor of Late Stevens but not much of the qualities of Chesapeake, though he grew it for twenty-five years as his most profitble variety. Seed must have been sown as early as 1910, for by 1917 Mr. Kuhns had tested the selections and had a row of Aberdeen about 300 feet long. Aberdeen was first reported as promising by J.H. Clarke, of the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Station, in 1924. In 1927 he reported that it had fruited for four years and was promising each year (Clarke, 1927). Its most serious weakness was that it was too soft to ship, even though it outyielded Howard 17 (Premier). Occationally having high flavor, it is a free plant maker, producing large, medium red, soft, and mildly subacid fruit. In the 1930's it was grown in New Jersey quite widely on heavier soils and in other northeastern states. in 1935, Anderson of Illinois reported that Aberdeen was red stele-resistant, thus becoming of great inportance. In that year, A.S. Colby, of the Illinois Agricultural Experiment Station, made the cross Mastodon x Aberdeen. A high percentage (63.5 percent) of the resulting seedlings showed resistance to the disease. Clarke, in New Jersey, was already using Aberdeen as a parent and had made selections that were introduced as Pathfinder and Sparkle, both of which showed resistance. The U.S. Department of Agriculture made the cross Aberdeen X Fairfax to produce Temple which was selected in 1939 and introduced in 1943.

Medium early. Probably the most widely grown variety in the northern part of North America (1916). A very cosmopolitan sort, succeeding almost everywhere. It is the logical sucessor of Wilson in this respect. It tends to produce too many plants, rusts considerably and the berries are variable in size, but they are attractive of good quality and produced freely. During the latter of the season the berries run small, because of numerous runners. It is better to restrict these to a narrow ros. The ripe fruit can remain on the vines a long time whithout becoming soft. They are likely to lose their bright color and look dead on the market. Dunlap is one of the best pollinizers for pidtillate sortes as it blooms profusely from early to late. It is hardy and thrives under neglect almost as well as the Wilson and Crescent. It is not firm enough for distant markets. A good variety for canning.Fletcher, 1916.----------Senator Dunlap. The high quality and handsome appearance of the berries make Dunlap a great favorite for the garden and local markets in the northern states east of the Rocky Mountains. In the northern Mississippi Valley, it is grown almost exclusively. Besides the characters named for the fruits, the variety has to  its credit hardy, healthy, productive plants.

LATEGLOW has produced excellent crops of fresh market fruit in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland and has shown promise in more limited testing in Ohio and Minnesota. LATEGLOW flowers late with Allstar, Delite, and Guardian. It usually ripens with Delite and Rosanne, after Allstar, Guardian, and Scott, but ahead of Marlate and Redstar. LATEGLOW yields vary from medium-high to high, comparable to Guardian, Redchief, and Raritan., but slightly below those of Allstar. Marketable yields of LATEGLOW are very high, comparable with those of Lester. Fruit of LATEGLOW is very large to large, initially the size of Allstar, and averaging that of Guardian. LATEGLOW fruit is very uniform in symmetry and attractiveness and has firm flesh that is medium red, juicy, sweet, and aromatic. LATEGLOW fruit 'skin' is as tough as that of Earliglow and matures to a glossy deep scarlet color. Plants of LATEGLOW are medium in size and runner freely. They are very resistant to the root rots, red stele, and Verticillium wilt, and vary in reaction to the leaf diseases. LATEGLOW plants are susceptible to anthracnose and leaf blight, and tolerant to powdery mildew, leaf spot and leaf scorch. LATEGLOW fruit is tolerant to gray mold and leather rot. LATEGLOW will extend fruit production into a season in which there are no red stele resistant cultivars of comparable quality.LATEGLOW is suggested for production of fancy quality, late-season fruit, especially in areas where root diseases may be a problem. Leaf disease problems are controlled with normal fungicide sprays for Botrytis control.

'Bountiful' fruit is brightly colored and possesses good processing qualities. It is suitable for machinge harvesting with potentially high yields of late-season ripe fruit from single harvests.'Bountiful' plants have a low spreading habit and are less erect than 'Benton' or 'To-tem' plants. 'Bountiful' freely forms runners and can be grown by hill or matted row culture. Although some of its flowers are exposed outside of the leaf canopy during bloom, some risk of frost injury is avoided due to a later bloom period than 'Totem'.'Bountiful' fruit are conic in shape. The calyx is appressed and easily removed when picked. Externally, the fruit is a bright red. Internally, the fruit is a uniform full red but not as dark as 'Totem'. In 1988, the anthocyanin content of 'Bountiful' fruit harvested at Au-rorawas397 mg-g-1 as compared to 'Totem' at 749 mg-g-1. 'Bountiful' is suitable for slice -and-freeze processing. Firmness scores were similar to those for 'Totem'. Pre-serves made from 'Bountiful', evaluated by a sensory panel in 1989, were rated as superior, in preliminary data, to those made from 'To-tem' in the freshly made product and that stored for 12 months.HortScience 1994USDA/OSU Small Fruit Certified Stock.

Tested as MSUS 70, US 70 resulted from a cross made in 1979 at Beltsville between Florida selection 76-802 (FL 73-1965 x FL 73-780) and Louisiana selection 2556. Seedlings from the cross were inoculated in 1980 at Poplarville with C. fragariae isolates CF-1, CF-4, FLA-2, MS-9, and FLA-1. Resistant seedlings were grown at Poplarville, and US 70 was selected in 1981. US 70 was used by Smith and Black (1990) as a differentiating cultivar to separate races of C. fragariae and C. acutatum. In Mississippi hill culture trials,US 70 produced as well as the standard cultivar Tangi in 1990 and 1991, as well as 'Chandler' in 1990, and better than 'Chandler' during the abbreviated 1991 season. US 70 fruit were later than and the same size as 'Tangi' fruit in 1990, but ripened with and were larger than those from 'Tangi' in 1991. US 70 fruit ripened with and were smaller than 'Chandler' fruit in 1990, but they ripened with and were larger than 'Chandler' in 1991.The outstanding features of US 70 are high resistance levels to leaf spot [Mycosphaerella fragariae (Tul.) Lindau], leafscorch [Diplocarpon earliana (Ell. and Ev.) Wolf], powdery mildew [Sphaerotheca nurcularis (Wallr. ex Fr.) Jacz. f. sp.fragariae], anthracnose crown rot, and two-spotted mites (Tetranychus urticae Koch); good fruit quality; desirable, bright red, and large fruit; and an extended harvest season.US 70 plants are medium-sized and compact, with medium-green leaves and three leaflets of equal size. Central leaflets curve down at the tips, and side leaflets curve up at the margins. Leaf serrations are rounded but pointed at the tip. Veins on the leaf underside are prominent, and leaf petioles are light green and pubescent. Fruit of US 70 have a shouldered wedge shape with a blunt tip; narrow, pointed fruit cap sepals that are partially reflexed at maturity; and slightly raised, yellow achenes. US 70 fruit are firm fleshed, light pink internally, and juicy.

It was screened in 1986 against the aggressive and virulent CF-63 isolate of C. fragariae, and it was selected in 1988 in Poplarville. Southern Florida production of US 292 was lower than that of 'Chandler', but US 292 showed high resistance to anthracnose crown rot, two-spotted mites, leaf spot, and leaf scorch. It generally had good plant health and ability to generate runners. During the more normal 1990 season in Mississippi, US 292 yielded as well as 'Chandler' but less than 'Tangi' (Table 1); its fruit ripened later and its plants were more vigorous than either stan-dard cultivar. US 292 fruit was larger than 'Tangi' fruit and the same size as 'Chandler' in 1990, but larger than either standard in 1991. In Maryland, US 292 was a promising late -maturing clone in matted row production. It showed a fine balance of fruit and plant traits, producing an outstanding plant bed and fruit with superior size, symmetry, firmness, skin color and gloss, flesh color, and flavor.US 292 plants are medium-sized with an open habit and are disease-free in the field. Its leaves are deep green on top, light green underneath, and slightly down-curved with promi-nent veins and hairy petioles. US 292 fruit have firm skin and flesh, and are flavor-ful, aromatic, and slightly acidic. The fruit is short conic and medium-large in appearance, with slightly raised achenes.

He served with the British in the American Revolution. Upon the division of Quebec into the two Canadas, he was appointed (1791) lieutenant governor of Upper Canada. In 1792 he arrived at Niagara (which he called Newark), his temporary capital; he moved to York (now Toronto) in 1793. Zealous to make the province a strong colony, Simcoe encouraged immigration (particularly of the American Loyalists), fostered agricultural development, and urged the imperial government to establish a provincial college. He was sent (1796) to take part in the ineffective campaign in Haiti and then returned to England. http://www.encyclopedia.com/html/S/Simcoe-J1.aspAdam Dale and C. L.

The rhizomes are covered with a dark brown papery coating, with few root hairs between root nodes.  Once established either by seeding or sprigging, Shoshone is capable of spreading into even stronger saline soils.  The hard seed coat, in part, creates both a physical and physiological seed dormancy, requiring that the seed be planted only in the late fall or winter.  Wet, cold conditions are necessary to trigger germination.   Shoshone has a shorter stature of 60-100 cm and is leafier than the native beardless wild rye.  The majority of the leaves are basal or low on the seed-bearing culm.  Leaves are light green to a yellowish-green.  The seed-head of Shoshone are more compact with much shorter lemma awns.  The seed of Shoshone does not shatter when mature, allowing direct-cut combining of seed.  Shoshone has approximately 400 seeds per gram.",1328976,PI 434040,Leymus,,,Leymus triticoides,Leymus triticoides

Prince and Co., of New York, as early as 1843. Tree: Tall, upright; vigorous grower. Main branches - Long, moderately stocky, upright. Twigs - Moderately vigorous. Lenticels - Somewhat variable in number and size. Foliage - A little below average in density. Blade - Variable in size. Shape ovate to elliptical-ovate. Petile - Length variable. Glands, one to four, commonly two, small to medium size, yellowish or grayish, round or oval. Bearing habit - Average light, distinctly an alternate bearer. Immature nut - Size small to medium. Comments: The chief point in favor of this variety is its late blooming habit. It is a shy bearer, however, and frequently an alternate bearer. The nuts and kernels tend to be small except when the crop is light, and they are of mediocre quality. The trees of this variety are apparently long lived and are thrifty growers.

Hedrick, Publishing 1911:   Early records indicate that the Blue Perdrigon was introduced into England from Italy. Hakluyt, writing in 1582, says, ""Of late time the Plum called the Perdigevena was procured out of Italy, with two kinds more, by the Lord Cromwell, after his travel.""  Gough, in his ""British Topography, states that Lord Cromwell introduced the ""Perdrigon plum"" into England in the time of Henry VII.  From these accounts it would seem that the plum was established in England some time during the latter part of the Fifteenth Century.  For three hundred years it thrived so well in England that writers had no hesitation in pronouncing it their best plum.  From England it came early to America.  Probably it was included in the shipment of plum pits ordered from England by the Governor and Company of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in New England in 1629.  In spite of its Old World reputation, however, it never found favor here and is now rarely if every seen even in collections.  The older writers mentioned a Black Perdrigion which they considered distinct from the variety under discussion.  Inasmuch as all plums until recently were propagated from seed, it is more likely that there were graduations in color and that some attempted to classify the darker seedlings as a distinct variety.  This hypothesis is borne out by the fact that after grafting and budding became the common propagation the so-called Black Perdrigon became extinct.  The following description is a compilation.  Tree vigorous, but not always productive; young shoots pubescent; fruit mid-season; medium in size, obovate, compressed on the suture side, purple or blue, with thick bloom; stem slender; skin thick, very tough; flesh greenish-yellow, firm, rich, sweet, aromatic; good; stone small, flattended, clinging; fruit hangs on the tree until it shrivels.",1614463,DPRU 2420,Prunus,,,Prunus domestica,Prunus domestica

Per Hedrick:  ""White Heart is mentioned in The Cherries of New York only because of its reputation in Europe and the frequent references, therefore, that American cherry-growers see to it in European publications.  Bunyard and Thomas, in the reference given, speak of it as one of the best and most profitable cherries grown in the famous Kent cherry orchards.  Early American horticulturists describe it but it seems not to have been widely grown in America and has probably long since passed from cultivation.  It failed, according to Elliott, because it was a 'variable and uncertain bearer' and while an early cherry 'not early enough to compete with many new varieties.'  [. . .]  It seems to have been brought to America before the War of the Revolution and to have been grown in this country under the serveral different names which are given in the list of synonyms.  The following description is compiled:  Tree large, vigorous, somewhat erect, very healthy, rather productive; branches stocky, somwhat angular, with large, roundish, light colored lenticels; internodes of unequal length; leaves medium in size, oval or obovate, sharply pointed; margin finely serrate; petiole short, slender, tipped with two reuniform, orange-red glands; flowers medium in size; petals obovate.  Fruit matures early in June; rather small, roundish-cordate, often one-sided, with a distinct suture; color whitish-yellow, tinged and speckled with pale red in the sun; stem long, slender, inserted in a wide, shallow cavity; skin firm; flesh light colored, firm, half-tender, breaking, juicy, sugary, pleasant; first quality; stone rather large, roundish-oval, with a pointed apex.""",1684587,DPRU 2600,Prunus,,,Prunus avium,Prunus avium

On sand dunes the lower branches are often buried by shifting sand and roots begin to develop from the branches, this is known as layering.  From this layering effect, beach plum can spread up to 6 m.  In a sand dune environment, this shrub rarely exceeds 2.1 m height, while inland it can reach heights of up to 5.5 m.  Ocean View has pale green foliage with alternate leaf and branching character.  The serrated leaves are elliptical to ovate in shape; they range from 3.8 cm to 6.4 cm long and half as wide.  The underside of the leaves is covered with fine hairs and paler above while the upper surface in rough and ridged.  In early spring, before the leaf buds break, axillary clusters of snowy-white blooms emerge.  These flowers are 0.6 cm to 1.9 cm in diameter, and cover the actively growing crown of the shrub.  Prior to falling off, these flowers take on a pink hue.   At about the time the flowers drop off, the leaves emerge, protecting the developing fruit. The edible purplish-black to red fruit are 1.3 - 1.9 cm in diameter; they are covered with a heavy, white, waxy film to protect them from fungi and disease.  The single pit, contained inside the drupe type fruit, is truncate at the base, ovate and swollen.  The fruit ripens on the shrub from August to October, but sometimes remains on the plant in the form of a raisin well into the winter months.",1694863,DPRU 3375,Prunus,,,Prunus maritima,Prunus maritima

However, the variety has several faults and does not deserve its popularity. Faults are: the fruits are very small and uninviting in appearance and taste; the foliage is susceptible to mildew and phids; and canners, to whom gooseberries are mostly sold, do not like the fruit. Good characters are : the plants are very hardy, vigorous, and productive; the variety thrives under a great diversity of conditions; the berries are rich, sweet, and of excellent quality. This is the oldest American gooseberry of note, having originated with Able Houghton, Lynn, Massachusetts, in 1833. It is probably a hybrid between a European and an American Gooseberry.

Crandall was introduced in 1888. It is grown for its attractive and fragrant large yellow flowers that are followed by large, juicy berries. The dark red to black berries have a pleasant taste for fresh eating or make a flavorial jam, jelly, syrup or spread. Crandall doubles as an ornamental and fruit producer which is not susceptible to White Pine Blister Rust, also immune to cane blight.Plants of the largest size, often 8 feet high, very vigorous, upright, slightly spreading, very dense, variable productivity, young shoots light and dark brown glossy, pubescent, numerous.Flowers midseason, large, partly closed, golden yellow, in short, dense, few flowered fragrant clusters.Fruit very late, period of ripening unusually long, medium thick, pubescent berries, variable in size small to very large, roundish oblate, to slightly obovate, not very juicy, somewhat soft seedy, sprightly to rather tart with strong taste, quality poor to fair. SFNY. 1925.-------------------Crandall is the sole representative of R. odoratum widely distributed throughout the country, being a familiar inhabitant of dooryards and parks as an ornamental. The tough skin and unpleasant flavor condem it as a garden plant. The variety is often sold under the name Flowering Currant. There is said to be a productive strain on the market. Plant 8 feet in height, very vigorous, hardy, unproductive. Leaves roundish cordate, 3 inches broad, thin, pubescent on bot surfaces; margins coarsely serrate; petiole short, slender; Flowers late, yellow, few ; pedicels short, pubescent, green. Fruits borne in clusters of 1 to 5 drop when ripe, 1/2 inch in diameter, round-oblate, black, glossy, smooth; flesh greenish-yellow rather dry, sprightly, very aromatic; quality fair seeds many.Hedrick, U.P. 1922.

From Seeds collected in Crescent City. My plan was to breed garden variety gooseberries to my divaricatum seedlings that sprouted most promptly. Thereby producing seedlings that would not malinger in the garden after a mild Winter. After the first year of growth I threw away the weakest growers and planted the most vigorous growers in one pot and the slower growers in another pot. That first Winter was a very mild winter and so it was the perfect opportunity to identify those seedlings with a low chill requirement. The first seedling to leaf out was one of the slower growers and the second was one of the vigorous growers. It was two or three weeks behind the first plant. I threw away the other seedlings and kept the first two for breeding. I mostly pollinated gooseberry #1 and only pollinated gooseberry #2 when all of the open flowers on gooseberry #1 had been pollinated or if I had some pollen from something that wasn't quite first rate.It turns out that smaller plants tend to leaf out earlier than bigger plants and gooseberry #2 was generating better low-chill seedlings.All of my R. divaricatum X Old World gooseberry type seedlings and my divaricatum X missouriense and divarcatum X Abundance and Pixwell and divaricatum X nivalis seedlings got severe root rot. They are growing so slow that they all look about the same. One of my divaricatum X white-stemmed gooseberry seedlings that I grew from a small batch of seeds from years ago seems to be root-root resistant, as are a small pecentage of my divaricatum X Malling Invicta seedlings and a larger percentage of my divaricatum X Oregon Champion seedlings. A small pecentage of my gooseberry #1 seedlings produce more robust growth than their sisters and they also seem to be slower to break dormancy. The plants I am sending you represent my only thicker, slower seedling that is also resistant to root rot. I imagine that my thicker seedlings are likely to produce bigger berries. Also the original specimen produced a few flowers this year and the buds are slightly fuzzy. I expected the buds to be completely glabrous because the green-fruited, mildew resistant clones at your repository looked so hairless that they appeared to be constructed from wax. (I'm thinking of Robustenta and Mucurines.) So I don't think the Invicta side of the parentage include the chromosomes with the mildew resistance linked with the European fruit quality.Nothing about this plant suggests that it can help my breeding program but but I also don't think I'm ever going to come up with a bigger, better first generation hybrid. Witness that I am naming this clone after myself, the Cowcester, after my last name and the Worcesterberry.

Perhaps it is not too much to say that it is still the best known and most widely grown of all dewberries, if the loganberry, here included with dewberries, be excepted. At the same time it is probable that it is past its prime in popular favor and that it is being superseded by other sorts. This dewberry came to its high estate in the small fruit culture. of the country because the plants grew splendidly on a great diversity of soils and in a range of latitudes from the coldest to the warmest in which, this fruit can be grown *L 'o plants have the faults of being susceptible to anthracn-ose, and of producing many double blossoms of which' 1 are sterile. The fruits are large, jet black, very handsome, not of the highest quality, and are often variable in size. To have them at their best they must be permitted to become fully mature before picking. Unfortunately several other varieties are commonly substituted by nurserymen for Lucretia, so that many growers who think they have it do not have it. The American Pomological Society added Lucretia to its list of recommended fruits in 1889. (For a fuller discussion of Lucretia, see page 197.) Plants vigorous, trailing, require protection in the winter, almost immune to orange-rust, susceptible to anthracnose and double-blossom especially in the South, very productive; canes slender, cylindrical, long, numerous, dull green mingled with brown, pubescent, eglandular; prickles small, slender, numerous, greenish; leaflets 3-5, sometimes 7, small, oval, dull, attractive, dark green, smooth, pubescent, with dentate margins; petiole slender.

It is named for the late John W. (Jack) Hull, formerly of the University of Maryland. the University of Arkansas, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, who spent most of his life breeding blackberries and raspberries. 'Hull Thornless' is the fifth in a series of tetraploid, genetically thornless blackberry hybrids developed by the USDA and cooperating agencies (4). It is adapted principally to USDA Plant Hardiness Zones 6-8.Origin'Hull Thornless'. tested as SIUS 68-6-6. originated from a cross made in 1968 by Jack Hull of SIUS 47 x by 'Thornfree' (Fig. 1) and selected by him in 1972 at Carbondale, Illinois. This cross was a repeat of an earlier cross which yielded the promising selections SIUS 64-21-8 ('Dirksen Thornless') and SIUS 64-21-11 ('Black Satin'). Since being selected, 'Hull Thornless' has been tested principally in Maryland and Ohio.Description and performance'Hull Thornless' plants are multistemmed with biennial thornless, vigorous canes. They are essentially crown-forming, and semi-erect after the first year in the field. 'Hull Thornless' is winter-hardy south of a line from Urbana, Ill., to central Ohio, to western Maryland, southern Pennsylvania and northern New Jersey (Zone 6 on the USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map.) In a greenhouse forcing trial at Beltsville, 'Hull Thornless' needed 750 consecutive hours under 7.2'C to satisfy its chilling requirement. Under conditions of high fertility. and good moisture, plants should be set at 1.8 to 3 m apart and trained onto a 2- or 3-wire trellis. Mature cane bases can be 5 cm in diameter, are self-supporting, and can grow to 4-5 m in a year. Canes are usually topped at 2 meters and lateral shoots are forced for fruiting the following year.'Hull Thornless' is similar to 'Black Satin' in yield and fruit size (Table 1).The thornless blackberries yield very well at an early age (third year) and the yield rankings of the several cultivars at the same age do not vary appreciably with soil difference (compare trial 1 and trial 2 at age 3 years). 'Hull Thornless* and 'Black Satin' are usually the heaviest yielding and the largest fruited of the 5 thornless cultivars, ranging from 8 to 3 g/berry over the harvest season.'Hull Thornless'. on a heavy soil at Beltsville, bloomed 8-9 days later than 'Dirksen Thornless' and 'Black Satin', but it ripened between 'Dirksen Thornless' and 'Black Satin'. On a light soil, 'Hull Thornless' ripened ahead of 'Dirksen Thornless' and 'Black Satin'. Fully ripe fruit of 'Hull Thornless' is firmer, sweeter, colors better and is tougher than 'Black Satin'. 'Hull Thornless' fruit, like that of the other named cultivars, makes a superior jelly or baked product.The superior yielding ability of *Hull Thornless' appears to result from a combination of high number of berries/fruiting lateral and large fruit size, whereas that of 'Black Satin' is attributed to many fruiting laterals/ cane and large fruit size. 'Hull Thornless' and 'Black Satin' do not differ in number or length of bearing canes per plant. The high vigor of 'Hull Thornless' and 'Black Satin' contributes to continued productivity with increasing plant age. 'Dirksen Thornless . , which has lower plant vigor, shows declining yield with advancing plant age. 'Hull Thornless' plants can be well propagated by tip layering, by rooting of I -node softwood stem cuttings (6), or by micropropagation techniques (2).introduced by USDA tested as SIUS 68-6-6.Cultivar Synonym= Tested as SIUS 68-6-6WHY NAMED= Thornless habitNAMED FOR= Jack Hull, who made the original cross in 1968",1448271,PI 553299,Rubus,,,Rubus hybr.,Rubus hybr.

(Queen of the Market, Quimby Favorite) - is now the most commonly grown red raspberry in America [in 1925], chiefly so because it adapts itself better to the varied climates and soils of raspberry regions than any other red variety. Cuthbert seems to grow best on sandy land, but thrives on a wide range of soils, and is as hardy to cold and endures heat as well as any other red raspberry. The plants are usually healthy and productive, but are more seriously affected by leaf curl than almost any other sort, and are quite susceptible to the dreaded mosaic. The faults are that the plants are not as productive as those of a good commercial sort ought to be and the crop ripens too late for many northern markets. The berries are of handsome red color, medium firm of flesh, and of very good quality when not overripe. As the berries pass maturity, however, the quality deteriorates and heavy bloom detracts from the attractiveness of the fruits. Cuthbert was found as a chance seedling by Thomas Cuthbert in his garden at Riverdale, now a part of New York City, about 1865. It was thought the variety might be a seedling of Hudson River Antwerp since it came up near a bed of that sort. The variety was not disseminated until about 1880, but since that time it has been widely grown. The berry was grown in different localities under various names but for the last quarter-century it has been known only as Cuthbert. The American Pomological Society added the variety to its list of recommended fruits in 1881. Plants tall, vigorous, upright-spreading, hardy, not very productive, very susceptible to leaf curl, contract mosaic slowly, moderately injured; propagated from suckers; canes numerous, somewhat stocky, light green becoming yellowish brown, with a very thin, whitish bloom, with eglandular tips; prickles very small, slender, numerous, green or slightly tinged red at the tips; leaflets usually 5, medium in size, pale green, very light colored beneath on the bearing canes, often curved, long-oval, dull rugose, with serrate margins; petiole slender, glabrous, slightly glaucous. Flowers medium in season; pedicels eglandular, pubescent; calyx prickly. Fruit late, season long; medium to large, uniform, retains size well through the season, conical, dull, dark red, with heavy bloom; torus roughish, pointed; drupelets small, very uniform, with strong coherence; cavity-scars conspicuous; flesh juicy, of but medium firmness, sweet, rich, aromatic; very good in quality. -- U.P. Hedrick. 1925. The Small Fruits of New York. A remarkably strong, hardy variety; stands the northern winter and southern summers equal to any. Berries very large.

The most likely explanation of the word nootka is that the first Europeans to go there heard the First Nations People say noo-ka-eh, the imperative of the local very meaning ""go around"".The 'Nootka' cultivar was not successful when it was first released, mainly because it was not that different than 'Willamette' the standard cultivar of the time. However, there is renewed interest in the cultivar because it seems to be resistant to the potentially devastating pollen borne raspberry bushy dwarf virus and, as well, has a particularly high level of soluble solids and is well-suited to machine harvest.

The Tolkomelen word has the sense of 'quieter waters at the head' or 'travel by way of a backwater or slough'. The name was considered particularly appropriate since 'Chilliwack' produces firm fruit that travels well.The 'Chilliwack' cultivar has had great success in the Santiago area of Chile and in the state of Victoria in southeastern Australia.

Ochre here refers not to the color but to the mineralized substance (usually red or yellow) much prized by the First Nations People for use as a base for paint or dye.The 'Chilcotin' raspberry is appropriately named since its color is bright, non-darkening red. The cultivar is credited with re-vitalizing the fresh market in BC. It is no longer grown extensivley in BC where it has been replaced by cultivars like 'Tulameen' and 'Malahat'. It still is important in New Zealand where it has a relatively small but significant share of the market.

Algonquin Park, the oldest provincial park in Ontario, is located 210 km north of Ontario.  The name is appropriate as the cultivar performs particularly well in Ontario and is winter hardy.A unique feature of the 'Algonquin' cultivar is its homozygosity for resistance to the common strain of Amphorophora agathonica, the North American aphid vector of the raspberry mosaic virus complex.   Since resistance is based on a single gene pair, the use of 'Algonquin' in breeding programmes gives non-segregating progenies.Hugh Daubeny and Tom M.

NEWBERRY, Port Angeles, WashingtonIn the month of July in the year of 1941, we took a number of plants from our place when the Government took over for a housing project; namely, Boysenberries, Loganberries, St. Regis Everbearing Raspberries, and Cuthbert Raspberries.We were not too careful digging them as we were in a hurry and took them over to this place, dug a big round hole and chucked them in, all mixed up, and trampled the dirt down around them.That summer was very dry and hot. We did not have an opportunity to water them at all.Late the following spring we dug them out. We had a few Cuthbert Raspberry canes, a few St. Regis Everbearing canes, only one Boysenberry and three Loganberry canes. They showed but little life and all the Loganberry plants presumably died; but about 5 or 7 weeks later a plant came up about 5 or 6 inches from one of the stalks of Loganberries.The foliage of this plant appeared to be much different than any plant I had ever seen, so I went down and asked our County Agent, at that time the late C. D. Yeager, to come up and look at it. I said to him, ""Mr. ' Yeager, what kind of a plant is that."" He looked it over very carefully then said, ""Mr. Newberry, I don't know but I believe you have a Sport but we cannot tell if it is worth anything till it has fruit On it. It may not amount to anything."" So when the fruit was ripe, he came out again and our present County Agent Melvin Mickel was with him, and Mr. Yeager said I had a wonderful flavored berry and he advised me to take care of it but that in time it may revert back to one particular kind of the four varieties named.I waited about two years and it still kept its flavor and general appearance, and up until this time, to the best of my knowledge, has shown no indication of disease and in the year of 1946, I started proceedings for a plant patent from the U. S. Patent Office which patent is still pending.These canes reach a height or length of between 9 and 11 feet. They do not do well if they are cut back like a raspberry plant, and they are very much inclined to droop as their canes attain length, so, therefore, I trellis them on wire 42 inches high. I recommend that the plants stand 11 feet between each hill and not less than 6 feet between the rows. I have tried several different kinds of fertilizer and I find that chicken fertilizer or litter of straw is best.The berries have a tendency to cling far more than any raspberry I have ever seen, although they pick like a raspberry. The general public verifies the fact that they have a decided tart or tang in comparison with any raspberry they have ever tasted. They claim they make wonderful jelly, jam, preserves, and are excellent for pies , and stand up both as in flavor and appearance when frozen, and according to the response of the public in all categories they will soon be one of the most popular berries on the market.This year from 172 full grown plants and 244 plants set out last spring we had a total picking of approximately 3400 lbs. This year the first berry was ripe on the 1st of July and we are still picking about 3 boxes every 4 days.First amount worth mentioning on July 9, 1949, 8 crates, to a high of 14 crates and to a low of 1 1/2 crates on August 18, 1949, with a total picking between these dates of 34 pickings and gradually tapering off to the present date of November 29, 1949.At the present time the Western Washington Experiment Station has the plants, also the Oregon Station at Corvallis, Oregon.Mr. Melvin Michel, Clallam County Agent, is familiar with these plants and berries and would gladly answer any questions.named for F.

The assets which gave it high standing were productiveness and hardiness of plant, and large size and high quality of fruit. The fruits are especially firm, and therefore in favor with shippers. The berries hold their size well until the close of the season. It is now losing in popularity because of susceptibility to anthracnose, the streak disease, and rosette. Cumberland originated with David Miller, Camp Hill, Pennsylvania, and after having been grown locally for some years was introduced in 1896. In 1899 the American Pomological Society added Cumberland to its fruit catalog list. The variety was supposed to be a seedling of Gregg but this origin is doubtful.Plants tall, vigorous, upright-spreading, unusually hardy, very productive, susceptible to anthracnose and rosette, contract streak disease rapidly; canes smooth, greenish changing to light reddish brown, heavily glaucous; prickles large, long, thick, strong, very numerous, greenish; leaflets 3 to 5, of medium size, broadly ovate, rugose, with dentate margins; petiole medium in length and thickness, prickly, glabrous, glaucous. Flowers early; pedicels prickly, pubescent; calyx smooth. Fruit early midseason, ships well, usually holds up in size to the close of the season; large, conical, attractive black, clings well to the short, small, roundish torus, although the berry is released readily, heavily glaucous; drupelets large, round, with strong coherence so that the berries do not crumble; flesh juicy, firm, sweet, rich; quality very good.heritage black raspberry cultivar from Appalachian MountainsNAMED FOR= named for the Cumberland Gap Region of the Appalachian  Mts.",1448711,PI 553739,Rubus,,,Rubus occidentalis,Rubus occidentalis

It has been tested throughout the Pacific Northwest as WSU 738. 'Meeker' was released from the Washington State Univ. breeding program in 1967 (Brooks and Olmo, 1972) and is one of the leading commercial cultivars in the Pacific Northwest. 'Skeena' was released from the Agriculture Canada breeding program in British Columbia (B.C.) in 1978 (Daubeny, 1978) and is also commercially important in the Pacific Northwest. 'Skeena' was also the male parent of two other 1974 crosses that resulted in the release of 'Chilliwack' and 'Comox' from the Agriculture Canada, B.C., program in 1987 (Daubeny, 1987).The fruit has a pleasant, mild flavor.''Centennial' appears to be well-adapted in southern portions of the Pacific Northwest (south of about 48'N). It has not been reliably cold hardy at Abbotsford, B.C., and is not recommended where 'Meeker' may be damaged by cold. The fruit should meet the requirements of both fresh-market and processing uses; however, it is not suited to machine-harvesting.Although it has not been rigorously tested outside the Pacific Northwest, 'Centennial' has yielded well and produced large fruit at Raleigh, N.C. It also is being grown com-mercially around Watsonville, Calif. These indications suggest that 'Centennial' may be adapted to areas south of the location it was developed and tested.Centennial' is susceptible to Amphorophora agathonica Hottes, the aphid vector of the raspberry mosaic virus complex. However, in the Pacific Northwest, A. agathonica is most prevalent in British Colum-bia and northern Washington (Martin, 31988), where 'Centennial' would not be recommended because of potential winter damage. At Puyallup, where there is a high frequency of RBDV, 'Centennial' has tested positive for the virus using the ELISA technique.Appears to be well-adapted to the southern portions of the Pacific Northwest.

After years of painstaking efforts, the undesirable plants have been taken out, now having a variety that comes true and exactly alike.Due to the nature of their growth and over the long period of ripening, we have named it the Tree Everbearing Blackberry. It grows in any soil or climate, has stood twenty degrees below zero without any injury.  Berries are round, very large, extra sweet, yet enough acid for jams and jellies. An excellent keeper, has to be picked only once a week. Plants are very thorny, but berries grow on a long fruit stem in clusters of seven to thirty berries. Ninety percent of the fruit extends above the thorns. There being no berries on the market when they ripen, therefore its possibilities are unlimited as a commercial berry.Another feature why people prefer it: they grow up off the ground, ninety percent are free from dirt regardless of the weather. Rain must be in abundance or it must be planted where it can be watered. The undreamed of feature of this berry is that people in our towns and cities who have been deprived of fresh fruits may now grow all the berries they can use for pies, jams and jellies from six plants in their yard or small garden, taking no more care of , them than a common shrub. From a two-year-old plant we have gathered three gallons or 24 pounds. Three-year-old plants have broken all records with a yield of 6 gallons of fruit from one plant,Waller Brothers do not hesitate to recommend these plants as an excellent berry, as we have fruited some of them for the past several seasons with very satisfactory results.named because originated in Arkansas",1482860,PI 618499,Rubus,,,Rubus allegheniensis,Rubus allegheniensis

While CHINOOK has on average 5 node shorter canes than 'Heritage', the average number of fruiting nodes is only 1.4 less than 'Heritage' (16.4 vs 17.8). The spines on CHINOOK canes are infrequent with 2-3 purple spines per internode compared to 8-10 for 'Heritage'. CHINOOK is expected to be susceptible to the common strain of raspberry bushy dwarf virus (RBDV), however, CHINOOK has shown no particular susceptibility to fungal diseases. Very little botrytis fruit rot (Botrytis cinerea) has been seen on CHINOOK, although it ripens in the Pacific Northwest at a time when there is very little rain suggesting avoidance rather than resistance. When it has been planted in commercial fields infected with root rot, presumably Phytophthora fragariae var. rubi, it has not shown symptoms of the disease. CHINOOK is introduced as an early-ripening, primocane-fruiting berry for the fresh market where its production of early season, high quality, very firm fruit and high yields will make it a preferred berry for fresh market sales. CHINOOK nuclear stock has tested negative for tomato ringspot, raspberry bushy dwarf, and tobacco streak viruses by ELISA and has indexed negative on grafting to R. occidentalis. CHINOOK is not patented. However, when this germplasm contributes to the development of a new cultivar, hybrid, or germplasm, it is requested that appropriate recognition be given to the source. Further information or a list of nurseries propagating CHINOOK is available on written request to Chad Finn; USDA-ARS, Northwest Center for Small Fruit Research; Horticultural Crops Research Laboratory; 3420 NW Orchard Ave.; Corvallis, Oregon 97330. The USDA-ARS does not sell plants. In addition, genetic material of this release has been deposited in the National Plant Germplasm System, where it will be available for research purposes, including development and commercialization of new cultivars.",1646445,PI 638227,Rubus,Subsp.,idaeus,Rubus idaeus,Rubus idaeus subsp. idaeus

'Titan' has undergone field testing for many years at Geneva and on various commercial farms in the Northeast. Although it was an advanced selection, 'Titan' also was included in replicated yield trials conducted by P. Crandall, Vancouver, Wash.Titan produces a very large mild flavor and long  conical fruit. It's bright red color  and large size makes it an attractive fruit for redi-pick or you-pick sales. It is winter hardy to 15 degrees F. Although Titan can be very productive, it has shown succeptability to root rot and should be grown on beds or light soils. The exceptionally large fruit has also been reported to be soft under some growing conditions.'Titan' does not appear to be resistant to important diseases. Like most other cultivars, it is susceptible to tobacco streak virus, raspberry bushy dwarf virus, and tomato ringspot virus. Likewise, there is little evidence of resistance to raspberry mosaic virus or raspberry leaf curl virus, although these 2 viruses are of secondary importance in New York. 'Titan' appears to be as susceptible to cane disease and preharvest and postharvest fruit rots as the other cultivars grown in the Northeast.'Titan' is not well-suited to mechanical harvest as is practiced in the Northwest, because its fruit clasps the torus quite firmly.

VINTAGE, tested as ORUS 2786-5, was selected in Corvallis, Oregon in 2003 from a population grown from open pollinated seed of `Isabel' red raspberry.  'Isabel' is a patented cultivar (PP9,340) developed by Sweetbriar Development, Inc. (Watsonville, CA) that has proprietary selections as parents. VINTAGE is being released primarily due to its outstanding fresh fruit quality, especially flavor and bright color, in a primocane fruiting red raspberry that is suited for the fresh market. VINTAGE has been evaluated most extensively in trials at Oregon State University's North Willamette Research and Extension Center (Aurora, Ore.; OSU-NWREC) and in USDA-ARS plots in Corvallis, Ore. VINTAGE plants are similarly vigorous to 'Heritage' but the canes tend to be not as stiffly erect or as tall.  The canes have prickles that are denser basipetally and tend to be slightly less prickly than `Heritage'. The canes have shown no serious cane diseases.   VINTAGE ripens ahead of `Heritage' but later than `Autumn Bliss', `Chinook', and 'Rafzaqu' ('HimboTop' (R) ). The average harvest date of 5% ripe fruit is around 23-25 August, of 50% ripe fruit is 9-18 September, and of 95% ripe fruit is 7-8 October in the Willamette Valley of Oregon. VINTAGE has yields that are comparable to `Heritage', being slightly less in one trial and slightly greater in another. VINTAGE has consistently produced yields around 1.2-1.9 kg/plant.  VINTAGE fruit are similar in shape to `Heritage' but they are slightly less conical and more rounded.  The fruit is attractive, with uniformly sized, shaped, and arranged drupelets.  While the fruit are rated as very good for drupelet coherence, they may not hold together as tightly as `Heritage' but they have a comparable firmness. The fruit separate more easily from the plant than those of  'Heritage'.  The fruit are medium size (3.2-3.4g) and 20-35% larger than `Heritage'. One of the most outstanding characteristics of VINTAGE is its bright red, attractive color, much brighter and less dark than the fruit of `Heritage'. VINTAGE fresh fruit are very sweet and rate as excellent for flavor, much better than those of `Heritage'.  VINTAGE fruit have a combination of excellent sweetness (soluble solids 12.4-12.8%), moderate pH (3.41-3.45) and a moderate titratable acidity (11.5-11.9) helping to give the fruit a sweet flavor but the lower titratable acidity may prevent it from being a good processing berry.  In general the soluble solids and pH are higher than those of `Heritage' and the titratable acidity almost half of those for `Heritage' fruit.  The fruit texture when the fruit are eaten is more pleasant, less dry and seedy, than those of `Heritage'. VINTAGE is introduced as a very sweet, outstanding flavored, bright red, and large primocane fruiting red raspberry with excellent overall quality for the fresh market and yields comparable to current industry standards.

'Apache' blooms 2 to 3 days later than 'Arapaho' and 2 to 3 days before 'Navaho'. First harvest date for 'Apache' averages 15 days later than 'Arapaho' and 5 days later than 'Navaho'. Peak and last harvest dates of 'Apache' compared to 'Navaho' are 7 and 6 days earlier, respectively. On average, 'Apache' has a fruiting period of 1O days shorter than 'Navaho'. Fruit of 'Apache' are blocky and conical and very attractive with a glossy, black finish (Figure 2). Fruit firmness was rated lower for 'Apache' compared to 'Navaho' but comparable to 'Arapaho'. Soluble solids concentration of 'Apache' averaged 10.7% over five years, compared to 11.4% for 'Navaho' and 9.6% for 'Arapaho'. Flavor of 'Apache' was rated very good and intermediate between 'Arapaho' and 'Navaho'. Postharvest evaluations of 'Apache' indicated that it did not store as well as 'Navaho', but did perform better than 'Shawnee' in storage trials. Seeds of 'Apache' are significantly heavier than either 'Arapaho' or 'Navaho'. Canes of 'Apache' are thornless, and 'Apache' more erect than either of the comparative cultivars. 'Apache' can be grown in a hedgerow without trellis support, when primocanes are tipped at 1.1 m to control primocane length and encourage lateral branching. Vigor and health of 'Apache' ratings were higher than those for either 'Arapaho' or 'Navaho'. Ratings for winter injury for 'Apache' have been comparable to 'Arapaho' or Navaho'.

An elite thornless selection 'Sweetie Pie' (MSUS119) was identified from crosses with the thornless cultivar 'Navaho'. The most recent crosses were made between selections with 'Humble' as the source of rosette resistance and either 'Arapaho' or MSUS119 as the source of thornlessness. It is a challenge to select rosette resistant plants because we have not been able to develop a reliable screening procedure and all seedlings are screened in the field using natural infection. To determine the tendency of 'Humble', 'Brazos', and 'Rosborough' to transmit rosette resistance, we studied its heritability in blackberry. Only 'Humble' transmitted enough resistance to be usable as a parent. We evaluated the effect of rosette on ripening date, yield, and berry weight. Berries ripened about the same time and weighed about the same when grown at either a rosette-free or disease- present location. However, yield was reduced on some clones and not others where rosette was present.",1914628,PI 672717,Rubus,,,Rubus hybr.,Rubus hybr.

Delite (mid season) was released from Georgia in 1969 from a cross of the Georgia selections T-14 x T-15 (T-14 later was named 'Bluebelle' and T-15 is a selection from 10-144 x W-8) (Brightwell 1969). The plant is moderately vigorous producing upright growth, with a small to medium size crown. Plant growth appears to be more sensitive to soil variations than most other rabbiteye blueberry cultivars. As with 'Climax', flower buds require less chilling than leaf buds. Many times 'Delite' will blossom and set fruit before many of its leaves develop. The chilling requirement of flower buds is 500 hours below 45 dregrees F. Anthesis to 50% ripe fruit is 98 days. In general, leaf color is yellowish-green, but higher rates of fertilizer containing nitrogen will create deeper green color. Berries are large, round, light blue in color, have a small dry stem scar, very firm, and not tart before they ripe. The flavor is preferred by many people over that of most other cultivars. The sugar-acid ratio is higher in 'Delite' than any other rabbiteye blueberry cultivar. Berries ripen late, a few days later than 'Briteblue'. Due to the firmness and ease of separation, it is an excellent cultivar to machine harvest. However, berry color is reddish-brown before fully ripe and there is a tendency to harvest before ripening is complete, making a red tinge to the pack.

Fruit large, round, light blue, excellent flavor. Received as Vaccinium ashei. Bluebelle (mid season) was released from Georgia in 1974 from a cross of 'Callaway' x 'Ethel' (Brightwell and Draper 1975). Plants are upright, moderately vigorous with medium crowns and very productive even at a very young age in the field. Enough new stems are produced to renew the plant each year. 'Bluebelle' is sensitive to soil conditions and drainage. Estimates of the chilling requirement for flower buds is 450-500 hours below 45 degrees F. Anthesis to 50% ripe fruit is 112 days. Berries are large, round, light red in color before ripening, then light blue upon ripening, and have good flavor, but are tart until fully ripe. Fruit ripening begins in mid-season and extends over a relatively long period. Under favorable environmental conditions, the berries size well throughout the harvest season, thus being an excellent pick-your-own cultivar. Berries get soft rapidly after ripening and tend to tear a little when harvested, therefore because of this and the red background color, 'Bluebelle' is not recommended for shipment. Berries do not sink in the wash tank for freezing, therefore there is much waste to the quantity harvested. The number of seeds average 66 per berry. -M.E. Austin, 1994. Rabbiteye Blueberries.

Tifblue (mid to late season) was released from Georgia in 1955 from a cross of 'Ethel' x 'Clara' (Brightwell1963). It is still the most popular rebbiteye blueberry cultivar today from the standpoint of appearance, productivity, harvesting, and shipping qualitites. It has become the standard in comparing other rabbiteye selections and cultivars. Plants make vigorous upright growth with small-medium crowns, producing sufficient suckers to replace old stems, and widely adapted. The chilling requirement for flower bud growth is 550-650 hours below 45 degrees F. (Austin and Bondari 1987A). Anthesis to 50% ripe fruit is 86 days. Berries are medium to large, light blue in color , berry firm with a small, dry stem scar. Berries appear to be ripe several days before fully ripe. Fruit cracking can be a problem with very wet soil conditions or after rain. The average seed number is 44 seeds per berry. Much research has been done with 'Tifblue' on fertilization, pruning , and general growth patterns. It grows and produces the best when grown at a soil pH range (4.6 to 5.3). At the extreme soil pH's, plants exhibit nutrient deficiencies. Late freezing temperatures sometimes occur during bloom which injures or kills flowers making them more susceptible to the disease, Botrytis. Sometimes cold injury is less visible, but it may affect the pistil or the ovules destroying the potential of fuit set or reduce the potential berry size. On the other hand, in a season with inadequate chilling, flowering occurs sporadically and fruit size is generally much smaller. What we thought was frost damage in the past may be a lack of pollination. -M.E. Austin, 1994. Rabbiteye Blueberries. Ag Science, Inc. Auburndale, FL p. 22.W. T. Brightwell and George M.

Heavy pruning or taking cuttings for propagation from young plants stunt growth and contributes to plant decline when plants are under stress such as drought, wet feet, etc. Observations have indicated that flower buds require less chilling hours than leaf buds. The chilling requirement of flower buds is 450-500 hours below 45 degrees F. (Austin and Bondari 1987A). Due to the time of flowering, late spring freezes greatly reduced yields. Asthesis to 50% ripe fruit is 78 days. Berries are medium in size, medium to light blue in color, have a small stem scar, excellent firmness, and aromatic flavor. Early ripening, three to five days before 'Woodard'. Ripening is concentrated. About 60% of the berries may be harvested at one time with minimum shriveled or overripe. Later ripening berries have much reduced fruit size, tough skin, and excessive seediness. It has proven to be especially well-adapted to mechanical harvest and is excellent for fresh pack. The average seed number is 73 seeds per berry. -M.E. Austin, 1994. Rabbiteye Blueberries. Ag Science, Inc.

Brightwell (early season) was released from Georgia in 1983 from a cross of 'Tifblue' x 'Menditoo' (Austin and Draper 1983). Plants are vigorous and upright with a small crown and produce enough new stems to renew the plant. The ease of berry separation from the plant adapt it for mechanical harvest for the fresh market. The plant is low chilling (350-400 hrs) (Austin and Bondari 1987B), but flowering is delayed sometimes after a late freeze giving it the ability to withstand late cold weather better than most other rabbiteye blueberry cultivars. It is an excellent cultivar to plant with 'Climax' for cross pollination. 'Brightwell' plants are very productive in the southeastern United States, southern France and northern Spain. The berries are medium to large in size, firm, light blue in color, have a small, dry stem scar and good flavor. 'Brightwell' ripens over a relatively short period beginning after 'Climax' and about the same season as 'Woodard'. Anthesis to 50% ripe fruit has not been determined. It is the most consistent produce of any rabbiteye blueberry cultivar for fresh market. Also, it is an excellent berry for the fresh market.

It is a first-generation hybrid between the wild highbush blueberries Brooks and Rubel and came from a cross-pollination in 1917. The original bush bore berries up to 18 mm in diameter. In field culture its berries sometimes reach a diameter of 20 mm, occasionally 21 mm. Concord berries are delicious when they are allowed to remain on the bush until they are fully ripe and have lost the excessive acidity they possess when they first turn blue.

In 1930 it was cross-pollinated with the Stanley blueberry, the most delicious of all varieties. Among the progeny was a bush that attracted attention first in 1935 and again in 1936. Its berries are sweet-subacid and delicious. On July 9, 1935, the largest berry was over 21 mm in diameter, and on July 24 of that year over 23 mm. On July 24, 1936, the largest berry reached 24 mm. If the season of 1936 had been a favorable one for the development of large individual blueberries, I am confident that the berries on this plant would have reached a diameter of more than an inch. There is now only a single bush of this variety. It will be several years before it can be propagated for a throrough field test of its qualities. Nevertheless, there are circumstances that seem to make it desireable to give a name to this variety at this time. Toward the end of the present fiscal year I terminate my connection with the Department of Agriculture after 49 years of botanical research. It was the custom of Linneaus and other scientific men of his time, when a public address was given in Latin, to end the address with a Latin word that meant, 'I have spoken,' ' I have said what I have to say,' or 'I am through.' Therefore, with orthographic apologies to the southern half of the United States, I name this blueberry and end this paper with that latin word - Dixi.'Blueberry growers should be careful not to misspell the name of the 'Dixi' blueberry, for the wrong spelling 'Dixie' may give the erroneous impression that this variety is especially adapted to cultivation in the south. The ancestors of the 'Dixi' blueberry were northern plants, and although the variety may be of value as far south as North Carolina, there is every reason to expect that it will not thrive in the Gulf States.Frederick V.

The other parent was a wild blueberry from the pine barrens of New Jersey named Rubel. This is, in form, the German spelling of the name of the old Russian coin, the rouble (sic). the name of the blueberry variety Rubel, however, is of neither German nor Russian derivation. The man who discovered this bush was Rube Leek. Rube did not seem an expressive name for a berry that was blue and beautiful and Leek was suggestive of a flavor that the berry did not posess. Rubel was a compromise, made up of Mr. Leek's first name and the initial of his last. The seed from which the Rancocas bush grew was the result of a pollination in the spring of 1915. Rancocas is a second early variety, ripening its berries later than Cabot and earlier than Pioneer. The original bush bore berries up to 18 mm in diameter. Berries in commercial plantations sometimes exceed 19 mm. Rancocas tends to the production of heavy crops on young and healthy bushes, so heavy indeed that unusual care must be taken to prune the bushes severely in order to insure a good crop in the following year. The leaves of Rancocas have finely toothed margins. The berries have a small, dry scar and are very easily picked. The name of this variety came from Rancocas Creek in New Jersey. Near this creek was the blueberry plantation in which the variety gave its first satisfactory performance.'Frederick V.

Upright bush of medium vigor Very consistent producer of quite small fruit with intense flavor and colorAfter almost 90 years of intensive breeding to make blueberries larger, lighter blue and thicker skinned we re-introduce Rubel, one of the first blueberry selections to be named. Despite the hundreds of new varieties released since 1912, this wild selection continues to be grown in many areas. Rubel offers consistent yields of small fruit borne on loose clusters, perfect for machine harvest. Rubel is well liked by processors because of its clean harvest, uniformly dark color, and low stem count. Food manufactures covet the small fruit as one of the best for muffins, yogurts, and dried products. Our newly released Rubel was carefully selected from a high producing, vigorous bush, thoroughly tested for viruses and phytoplasmas, and then tissue cultured for uniformity and vigor. We are very pleased with the results.Of additional interest to growers is Rubel's extremely high content of antioxidants, compounds that have been identified as playing a major part in improving eyesight, lowering cholesterol levels, and preventing cancer. We feel this recent research will open new markets for blueberries in general and Rubel in particular. We recommend Rubel for growers looking to mechanically harvest yet diversify their product base.Rube Leek was the discoverer Frederick Coville named it for Rube's first name and last initial - he didn't think that Rube or Leek was appropriate alone so he called the plant RubelWHY NAMED= Cultivar name from first name and last initial of Mr. LeekNAMED FOR= Mr. Rube Leek, of Chatsworth, New Jersey",1449789,PI 554817,Vaccinium,,,Vaccinium corymbosum,Vaccinium corymbosum

This Brooks-Chatsworth parent, which was never planted in the field, was recorded in the greenhouse in Washington as having 'Berries of delicious taste, sweet, slightly acid and of pronounced flavor.' This plant was pollinated with Rubel pollen in 1915 and the Scammell blueberry was one of the resulting seedlings. In the field the original bush of Scammell bore berries up to a diameter of 20.5 mm. On budded plants in the greenhouse in Washington they reached more than 22 mm. The berries have a medium blue color, firm texture and a small scar, and the calyx is almost wanting. The leaves are smaller than on most varieties of highbush ancestry, commonly 1.5 to 2 inches in length and five-eighths to three-quarters of an inch in width. The berries are sweet, subacid and have a high degree of flavor. They ripen in late midseason. Among New Jersey growers there has been little planing of this variety, apparently from doubt regarding its vegetative vigor.

Reasons given for this include the colonists' friendship with Monteo, a native of Croatoan Island, and a carving of the word 'C-R-O-A-T-O-A-N' into a post of the fort (and 'C-R-O' into a nearby tree), ostensibly to let John White know where they had fled. White was unable to search Croatoan Island because a hurricane hit the outer banks of North Carolina and blew his fleet to sea. After the storm abated, the fleet was low on provisions and decided to return to England. Non of the original colonists was found.

Elliott is an extremely strong grower, and a heavy, consistent producer that shows resistance to mummy berry, probably due to its late bloom period. It machine harvests quite well in warmer areas. This is probably due to Elliott's extra firm fruit and the tendency for fruit to remain strongly attached to the bush until ripe. Elliott is presently the best highbush variety for controlled atmosphere storage, which is extending the sellable shelf life for up to 12 weeks. This has the potential to further increase the value back to the grower.

Origin This cultivar, selected in 1960 at the South Haven Experiment Station, and tested as '100-H,' originated from a cross of 'I 9-H' x '36-H.' Both parents have a wild Michigan lowbush selection of Vaccinium angustifolium Aiton in their lineage. Description 'Top hat' has small leaves, inherited from the lowbush ancester. While its stems are small and the internodes short, plants can be propagated from hardwood cuttings. The fruit matures early, ripening about July 15 at South Haven, Michigan Yield has been medium in most years with about one-half pint (27 cc) of berries per bush. The berries are medium large, bright blue, firm with a small scar and good flavor. Use and culture There is increasing interest in using blueberries as ornamentals around the home. The plants are attractive with their white flower clusters in May, bright blue berries in July, and brilliant red leaves in the fall. Blueberry plants are grown successfully only when exacting soil requirements of the plant are satisfied. Plants require acid soil with a pH range of 4.5 to 5.2, high organic matter content, and a continuous and adequate moisture supply. Birds are readily attracted to the ripening fruit. Ornamental plantings generally need to be protected by netting or other means during fruit ripening if one does not want birds to harvest the fruit. 'Top hat' offers unusual ornamental fruit plant opportunity when these exacting cultural requirements are fulfilled.J. E. Moulton, Stanley Johnston, and R. l.

'Beckyblue' does not fit the norm for a phenotypically pentaploid, therefore, it is possible that it is pure V. ashei. Plants are mederately vigorous, and upright with a small crown. It has a low chilling requirement of 300 hours and will flower immediately after a period of warm weather, generally in mid-Febrauary in south Georgia. Anthesis to 50% ripe fruit is 82 days. Flowers are not self-fertile, but are cross fertile with other rabbiteye blueberry cultivars. 'Climax' is a good pollinator for 'Beckyblue' but 'Aliceblue' is not.

Bush erect with narrow crown at maturity. Medium to large fruit, very firm, light blue. Excellent flavorMisty has become the most popular variety in Florida where it is liked for its high yields and consistent quality. Here in the West we find Misty to be quite vigorous, growing very well both on the coast and in the inland heat. The fruit is of exceptional quality and one of the first to ripen. It is normally picked 3-5 times during harvest. Best results are obtained when Misty is pruned heavily to avoid over-cropping. Of particular interest is Misty's tendency to partially flower and fruit in the fall. Little is known of this phenomenon but there may be definite possibilities to harvest a spring and fall crop in areas with warm, extended falls. We recommend Misty for commercial production in areas with chilling as low as 150 hours and all areas with mild winters and hot summers.Misty.

ASHS Press. p. 175.Tetraploid 'southern highbush' type involving 3 species of Southern origin: V. darrowi, V. ashei, and V. tenellum This blueberry genotype is intended for release as a complementary cultivar to 'Reveille'. 'Bladen' is superior to 'Reveille, in fruit color development at harvest and for resistance to fruit cracking in wet weather.'Bladen' is early ripening (generally a little earlier than 'Reveille' and 'O'Neal') with good productivity, quality, fruit color, firmness, picking scar, and modest fruit size. It is the second highbush blueberry cultivar developed in North Carolina that is adapted to mechanical harvesting for fresh market outlets.Mechanically harvested fruit of 'Bladen' is equal or superior to hand harvested fruit of 'Croatan' for both fruit color and firmness. Picking ease is similar to 'Croatan', placing it in the desirable range for mechanical harvesting. The soluble solids/acids ration of the ripe fruit is significantly lower than 'Croatan' and similar to 'Bounty', indicating good potential for extended shelf life. Fruit storage studies also indicate that the shelf life of machine and hand-harvested fruit of 'Bladen' is generally superior to 'Croatan'.'Bladen' bushes are upright and vigorous with a slightly wider canopy than 'Reveille'. In greenhouse studies, the blossoms were not completely self fruitful. Planting a pollinator cultivar such as 'Reveille' or 'O'Neal' in every 5th row will insure adequate cross-pollination. Ripening is 4 to 5 days earlier than 'Reveille' if no freeze damage occurs to blossoms. Blossoming is also earlier than 'Reveille' -thus making freeze-protection irrigation absolutely essential for reliable cropping. 'Bladen' roots readily from either softwood or hardwood cuttings. It has shown excellent field resistance to stem canker, and some tolerance to stem blight and mummy berry.S. D. Rooks, J. R. Ballington, and C. M.

The seeds from this controlled hybridization were germinated in a greenhouse during the winter of 1974-1975. Resulting seedlings were planted in the spring of 1975 in an experimental plot at Earleton, Fla. The seedlings fruited in the spring of 1977 and one, designated FL 77-3, was selected for its outstanding fruit quality and low chilling requirement.  During 1977, the original plant selection was propagated asexually by rooting softwood cuttings, and a test planting of three plants was established. In 1985 the clone was again propagated by softwood cuttings and a 15-plant plot was established in 1986 at the Florida Agricultural Experiment Station Horticultural Unit at Gainesville, Fla. The new variety has been asexually propagated by softwood cuttings on at least four other occasions. It roots readily from softwood cuttings. During asexual multiplication, the vegetative and fruit char acteristics of the original plant have been maintained. Bushes of the new variety are medium in vigor and upright in growth. The plant produces enough basal shoots to renew the plant as it ages, but it is not a heavy sprouter. The plant produces a large number of flower buds, but the number of flower buds is not excessive if the plant is grown on favorable soils. The variety has shown no signs of delayed flowering or fruiting, even following winters in which fewer than 300 hours of temperatures below 7 C. were recorded. Plants of the new variety appear to be moderate to high in resistance to cane canker incited by Botryosphaeria corticus. They appear to be normal or above normal in resistance to Phytophthora root rot, stern blight, Botrytis blight, and fungi which cause defoliation in the fall. Plants of the new variety have a very low chilling requirement. Average date of 50% anthesis is 6 day before Georgiagem and 8 days after Sharpblue.  Average date of 50% harvest for the new variety is May 7, five days later than for Sharpblue and one day later than for Georgiagen. The average date of the first harvest from the new variety will be about May 1 in north-cen tral Florida. Fruit of the new variety are medium in size, averaging 1.6 g per berry. Color is dark blue with a moderately heavy waxy coating. Both the stem scar and the firmness are excellent, and the fruit detach readily from the plant when ripe. These last three characteristics should make the new variety a good candidate for mechanical harvest for the fresh market.

The North Carolina Agricultural Research Service, the Arkansas Agricultural Experiment Station, and the United States Department of Agriculture announce the release of the southern highbush blueberry cultivar 'Summit' for trial by growers and nurserymen. 'Summit' , labeled G-616, originated from the cross G-144 x F14-76 made in 1976 at Beltsville, MD., by A.D. Draper. It was tested in replicated trials at Waynesville and Castle Hayne, NC, and observation trails at Jackson Springs, NC, Hammonton, NJ, and Clarksville, AR. 'Summit' is recommended as a high quality hand harvest type cultivar for fresh market outlets or homeowner use. It is a mid-late season southern highbush blueberry that blooms about the same time as 'Croatan' in North Carolina and slightly earlier than 'Bluecrop' in Arkansas. Ripening season is approximately two weeks after 'Croatan'. It is consistent in production, with fruit size larger than 'Croatan' and 'Bluecrop'. Fruit color and flavor are excellent, fruit picking scar and firmness are superior to 'Croatan'. Fruit cracking and stemming were not a significant factor at the Castle Hayne, N.C. location. 'Summit' performed better than 'Bluecrop' and 'Climax' in post-harvest studies in Oklahoma.. The flowers of 'Summit' are self-fruitful based on greenhouse selfing trials in Raleigh, N.C. Plant habit is semi-upright with moderate vigor. It is not resistant to stem blight (Botryosphaeria dothidea) or anthracnose fruit rot (Colletotrichum sp.) though these have not been shown to be a severe problem over the last 10 years.

The male parent of BILOXI, US329, came from a cross of US210 X Florida 4-76 made at Beltsville, Maryland by A. D. Draper in 1978. US210 originated from a cross of US67 [(Florida 9A, V. darrowii) X (G-101, V. corymbosum)] X [US132 (Florida 4B, V. darrowii) X (V atrococcum)]. Florida 4-76 came from a cross of Bluecrop, V. corymbosum X 13-236, a seedling from (Florida 4B X V. ashei) X (a northern highbush X V. darrowii). Thus, two diploid, one tetraploid, and one hexaploid Vaccinium species contributed genes to the genotype of BILOXI. Plants grow upright, are vigorous and productive. Fruit is medium in size, has good color, flavor, and firmness, with small picking scar. Fruit ripens early, a few days earlier than Jubilee, but the bloom period is also early. This puts it at risk in years of late spring freezes. Should be interplanted with other southern highbush cultivars to facilitate fruit set, early ripening, and maximum yield.

They were selected to complement azaleas and camellias in landscape plantings. They also show potential for indoor culture as pot plants or in hanging baskets. EVERBLUE and JOHNBLUE are open-pollinated seedlings from seed collected in north-central Florida. They were selected at Castle Hayne, N. C. by G. J. Galletta and T. F.

C. and are currently under test in Louisiana and Virginia. Plants of these cultivars did not survive the first winter at Beltsville, Maryland. They are recommended for trial throughout eastern North Carolina and the southeastern United States. The new foliage of EVERBLUE and JOHNBLUE is an attractive blue-green and the foliage takes on a light pinkish hue during the fall and winter. The stems also turn reddish in the fall and winter. The fruit is small, sweet, flavorful, light blue in color and will attract birds. The plant shape of these new cultivars is generally a low rounded mound. JOHNBLUE will eventually reach a mature height of 3 feet in eastern North Carolina, and EVERBLUE is somewhat lower reaching about 2 1/2 feet. Both EVERBLUE and JORNBLUE perform equally well as specimen plants or hedges. For best results outdoors additional organic matter will have to be added to the planting hole, as in azalea and camellia culture. These cultivars may be propagated by softwood stem or branched shoot cuttings under intermittent mist. For best rooting the cuttings should be taken from the stock plants when they are growing actively. Potted and hanging basket plants respond to long-day photoperiod treatments for producing luxuriant blue-green foliage and new shoots.

Crossed in 1974 by A.D. Draper at Beltsville, Maryland. Selected in 1978 at the Atlantic Blueberry Company, Hammonton, NJ, and subsequently evaluated by A.D. Draper, G.J. Galletta, G. Jelenkovic, N. Vorsa, and M.K. Ehlenfeldt. CHANTICLEER (the rooster) was so named because of its characteristic of very early ripening. CHANTICLEER ripens its fruit 2-5 days earlier than 'Weymouth', the earliest leading cultivar, and is superior to 'Weymouth' in fruit size and color. Its fruit are medium sized, medium to light blue, with good scars, and good firmness. CHANTICLEER fruit is sweet, sub-acid, and mild -flavored. Production is equivalent to 'Weymouth'. Table 1 compares fruit characteristics of CHANTICLEER to 'Weymouth', 'Duke', and 'Bluecrop'. CHANTICLEER is an upright, moderate height bush, that flowers slightly later than 'Weymouth' offering improved avoidance from damage by late spring frosts. Observations have suggested it is resistant to mummy berry blight (Monilinia vaccinii-corymbosi.) Screening in North Carolina has shown it to be relatively resistant to stem blight (Botryosphaefia dothidea), but blighting has been observed in New Jersey on some younger plantings. CHANTICLEER has been a consistently good performer in New Jersey, but has been more variable in other regions, producing low to moderate yields in Michigan, Arkansas, Oregon, and North Carolina. CHANTICLEER is recommended as an early season cultivar primarily for commercial growers in northeastern temperate regions, including New Jersey and adjoining states. 'Chanticleer' is an early - maturing tetrapoid highbush blueberry that was developed by the cooperative breeding program of ARS and the New jersey Agricultural Experiment Station.A.D. Draper, G.J.

The female parent, NJ 89-158-1 came from a cross of two triploids, NJ 856-1 x NJ 859-1 made by Dr. Nicholi Vorsa (Rutgers University). The clone NJ 856-1 is a cross of G-434 (a sibling of PINK CHAMPAGNE) x NJ 85-CS (a pink-fruited, wild, 2x selection of V. corymbosum). The clone NJ 859-1 is a cross of V. darrowi >Florida 4B= x Rancocas (see attached pedigree, Figure 2). The cross that produced PINK LEMONADE was made by M.K. Ehlenfeldt at Chatsworth, New Jersey in 1991, and was selected in 1996 at the Marucci Center for Blueberry and Cranberry Research and Extension, Chatsworth, NJ. The selection was subsequently evaluated by M.K. Ehlenfeldt between 1996 and 2004, and also evaluated by C.E. Finn at USDA-ARS/Oregon State University test plots in Corvallis, Oregon. Its general characteristics are, mid-late- to late-season ripening, moderate yields, medium-sized, glossy fruit, bright pink fruit-color, mild pleasant flavor, and good firmness. Table 3 lists color data for PINK LEMONADE; Figure 4 shows fruit of PINK LEMONADE. The bush of PINK LEMONADE is vigorous, upright, and full (1.5 m high x 1.6 m wide). Leaves are glossy green and lanceolate, with a serrated leaf margins. Leaf surface texture is smooth, very similar to that of V. ashei. Winter-time twigs are dusky reddish-brown in color. Limited observations suggest that PINK LEMONADE has some resistance to the blighting phase of Monilinia vaccinii-corymbosi (mummy berry). Flowering time is similar to other southern blueberry germplasm, with flowers developing earlier than those of hardy northern cultivars such as Bluecrop. Plants are hardy in New Jersey, but fruit production is irregular, producing reduced, or no crops in years with late spring frosts, and moderate crops in years with mild spring temperatures. Cropping ability is most likely related to flower bud deacclimation and hardiness in spring. The ideal area of adaptation of PINK LEMONADE is unknown, but its background suggests that it might perform equally well, or better, in milder climates, including areas where rabbiteye cultivars can be grown. Because of the inherent self-fertility problems of rabbiteye germplasm, it is recommended that another rabbiteye cultivar be planted with PINK LEMONADE to ensure good cross-pollination. In some southerly locales, the cultivar Florida Rose, a pink-fruited cultivar recently released by the University of Florida, may be suitable for this purpose.Cultivar release by Mark Ehlenfeldt cross made in 1991, selected in 1996NAMED FOR= pink fruit color",1684918,PI 641330,Vaccinium,,,Vaccinium hybr.,Vaccinium hybr.

They come from 10 different clones of V. darrowii that were growing in pots outside our greenhouse in Gainesville. The parent clones came from rooted cuttings of plants we selected about five years ago. Two of the parent clones were from the Florida panhandle, along the Apalachicola River where Interstate 10 crosses the river. This woild be Liberty County, Florida. The other eight cloneswere from what I call the Lake Istokpoga area in Highlands County, Florida. These include one clone from Camp Cloverleaf (a 4 H camp near Lake Placid), two clones from the Archbold Biological Station in Lake Placid, and the rest from the southern shore of Lake Istokpoga.Lake Istokpoga is at the southern end of the Lake Wales Ridge, an area of pure white sand dunes overlying a shallow perched water table. The sand dunes date back to the previous inter-glacial period, I think about 200,000 years ago, when the sea was higher. The Lake Wales Ridge has many scrub plants, many endemic and highly endangered, and a totally different flora that surrounds the sink-hole lakes, largest of which is Istokpoga.These seeds will produce mostly the glaucous, short-statured phase of V. darrowii. However, in disturbed habitats such as where these plants came from, V. darrowii readily crosses with diploid V. corymbosum that lines the lakeshore, so the seedlings will also include some taller plants that are introgressed to some extent with Florida highbush genes.These packets of seed represent less than 20% of this year's seed yield from 10 pots, 3-gallon size. Although it is hard to find quantities of V. darrowii seed in the forest, save for exceptional years in which there is a huge crop (about once a decade), the plants are consistently extremely productive when grown in pots of peat. - Paul Lyrene (June 26, 2007)",1730135,PI 651630,Vaccinium,,,Vaccinium darrowii,Vaccinium darrowii

Quality of the fruit is rated high for the fresh market.  The fruits have a small dry picking scar and harvest without stems.  The bright blue berry holds the beautiful color long after harvest.  The flavor is very good and sweet and only mildly acid. Harvest is best done by hand for fresh markets.   The plants lend themselves to the mechanical harvest, the fruits do not ripen uniformly so mechanical harvesting is not advisable. Marketing is recommended for the fresh market or for the U-Pick trade.  This is an excellent berry for the U-Pick as the berries are big, bright blue, and delicious.

On fertile soils the extreme vigour of the grafted vines of this rootstock is a drawback because it induces zinc deficiency and bad setting of the berries. Dgo Ridge is not used as a rootstock in the Old World and its resistance to the phylloxera is seriously doubted.""

Since it is only moderately resistant to phylloxera and lime and very difficult to root, Dog Ridge has never been of commerical importance in France. Its good resistance to nematodes has made it useful in California in light, sandy, irrigated soils, and it can also be a useful rootstock in its native Texas. Dog Ridge is a very vigorous variety.

Growth habit: very vigorous, climbing. [ ... ] V. cinerea has several common names: Parra silvestre (in Mexico), Ashy-leaved grape, Sweet winter, Downy, Ashy, Gray black, and Wichita grape. In the past confused with aestivalis, cinerea was officially named a distinct species in 1883 by George Engelmann. [ ... ] Cinerea has a good resistance to phylloxera and the leaves do not carry the galls. However, it is chlorotic in limy soils and is extremely difficult to root, which rules out its usefulness as a rootstock. The maturity of the wood is often deficient at the time of the first frost owing to its late ripening. The resistance to fungus diseases is excellent, downy mildew, and black rot in particular. At present, the only cultivated descendants of cinerea are Black Spanish and Herbemont (aestivalis-cinerea-vinifera).""",1013303,DVIT 1364,Vitis,,,Vitis cinerea,Vitis cinerea

Per Galet (see citation):  ""ORIGIN: This rootstock was selected by the viticulture school of Oppenheim, Germany, from Teleki's Berlandieri-riparia No. 4 (see origin 5 BB); SO 4 is an abbreviation of Selection Oppenheim No. 4.  DESCRIPTION: Growing tip: downy, white with rose margin. Young leaves: cobwebby, green, more or less copper. Leaf: cuneiform, 136-3-24, entire, lateral sinuses 10, dull, yellowish, wavy, with upturned edges; petiolar sinus with a narrow V on narrow leaves which becomes an open U when adult; teeth convex, nearly flat; petiolar junction pink; petiole and veins pubescent. Flower: always sterile, male. Shoot: ribbed, purple nodes, slightly pubescent especially on the nodes. Cane: finely ribbed, glabrous with a few pubescent hairs on the nodes, dark chocolate brown, nodes inconspicuous; small, pointed buds.  APTITUDES: This is a vigorous rootstock which develops especially rapidly at the start and, like Riparia tends to favor fruit set and advance maturity. In field trials in the Champagne district, the vines grafted on SO 4 had a greater average production than those on 161-49 C or 41 B, but slightly less than on 5 BB. In the Mediterranean region, SO 4 has been criticized for its slender trunk, which may fail to support a nontrelised, head-pruned vine with a heavy crop.  Suited to humid, clay soils, it is not recommended for very dry conditions. Its resistance to active lime is approximately 17 to 18 percent and it has a good resistance to nematodes. According to Vidal and Marcelin (1968), it accepts up to 0.4g/kg salt content.  SO 4 roots well. It field grafts well and bench grafts satisfactorily. It produces a large amount of propagating wood. Introduced in France in 1941, there was an extensive planting of mother vines mainly to satisfy the demand for graftable cuttings in Germany. It is now the number one rootstock variety in France.""  Per Winkler (see citation):  ""SO 4 has only recently been placed in field trials in California vineyards. The moderate vigor of its scions indicates that it may not be suitable on high stress sites. For example, in a non-irrigated trial in Napa Valley, it has developed slowly, producing relatively small vines during the first few years. On the other hand, it may be quite satisfactory on irrigated, more fertile sites. This new stock to California deserves a thorough and intensive study in phylloxerated districts.""",1015425,DVIT 1675,Vitis,,,Vitis hybr.,Vitis hybr.

Per Hedrick (see citation):  ""Vine variable in vigor, usually very vigorous, climbing high, sometimes, when without support, shrubby and only three or four feet high; when growing in the shade often sending down aerial roots. Wood hard, bark smooth, not scaling off except in old age, with prominent warty lenticels; shoots short-jointed, angled, with fine scurfy pubescence; diaphragms absent; tendrils intermittent, simple. Leaves below medium in size, broadly cordate or roundish; petiolar sinus rather wide, usually shallow; margin with obtuse, wide teeth; not lobed; dense in texture, rather light green color, glabrous above, glabrous or sometimes pubescent along veins below.  Cluster small (6-24 berries), loose; peduncle short; pedicels short, rather thick. Berries large, globular or somewhat oblate, black or greenish-yellow; skin usually thick, tough, and with a musky odor; pulp rather tough; ripening unevenly and dropping as soon as ripe.  Seeds two to four, very large to medium, shaped something like a coffee-berry, somewhat flattened, shallowly and broadly notched; beak very short; chalaza rather narrow, slightly depressed with radiating ridges and furrows; raphe a narrow groove. Leafing, flowering and ripening very late.  The habitat of this species is southern Delaware, west through Tennessee, southern Illinois, southeastern Missouri, Arkansas (except the northwestern portions), to Grayson County, Texas, as a northern and western boundaryry, to the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf on the east and south.  It becomes rare as one approaches the western limit but is common in many sections of the great region named above, being most abundant on sandy, well-drained bottom lands and along river banks and in swamps, thick woodlands and thickets. [...]  The climate most suitable for Rotundifolia is that in which cotton grows and it thrives best in the lower portions of the cotton belt of the United States. On account of the late ripening of the fruit it requires a long season. Vines of Rotundifolia have been known to withstand a winter temperature as low as 12 degrees below zero, but under ordinary conditions this would undoubtedly be much too severe for most Rotundifolias. They do not suffer from the effects of hot summers but will not withstand drought and are not well adapted to semi-arid conditions. All growers of varieties of this species agree that it does best on light sandy or alluvial soils; and while it may grow on rather heavy clays, if all other conditions are favorable, its vigor will be lessened. [...]  Rotundifolia is remarkably resistant to the attacks of all insects and to fungal diseases. The phylloxera do not attack its roots and it is considered as resistant as any other, if not the most resistant of all American species. It is grown from cuttings only with difficulty. However, under favorable circumstances and with skilful handling, this is a successful method of propagation.""",1015534,DVIT 1694,Vitis,,,Vitis rotundifolia,Vitis rotundifolia

Per Galet (see citation):  ""ORIGIN:  This is a cross [...] was made by Ressuguier and sold to Teleki.  Teleki made the selection but the wood of five neighboring vines was mixed in with the original 8 B; this explains the existance of ""the 8 B's"" with female flowers in Vaucluse, Germany and Italy.  DESCRIPTION:  Growing tip: downy, white with rose margin.  Young leaves: cobwebby, bronze.  Leaf: very large, 20 cm (squared), cuneiform, 135-3-35, entire 00, soft, edges turned down, bullate, crimped around petiolar junction, pubescent below; petiolar sinus V-shaped; teeth convex, wide, obvious mucrones; petioles pubescent.  Flowers: male, always sterile.  Shoot: ribbed, pubescent, soft, nodes purple except at tip.  Cane: reddish-brown to chocolate with darker nodes; velvety pubescence; ong internodes; inconspicuous nodes, fairly large buds.  APTITUDES:  8 B is not an important variety in France. There are very few mother vines or vineyards planted on it since 5 BB is generally considered more satisfactory.  While it may be a little more resistant to drought than 5 BB, it is still less so than the Berlandieri-rupestris varieties.  It is sensitive to lime over 17 percent. Boubals and Huglin (1950) cite it as being among the varieties resistant to nematodes. 8 B produces a large amount of wood which grafts well, but roots less well.""  Per D.P. Pongracz, Rootstocks for Grape-vines pp. 100-101:  ""Selected by Teleki in 1902 from his group 'B'.  APTITUDES: Cuttings of 8 B do not root well, but once rooted they graft readily on the spot. [...] Its tolerance of soluable salts in saline soils is nil. It is classified as resistant to nematodes.  Because 8 B is very vigorous and tough rootstock, it was widely used in central and south-eastern Europe as a rootstock, but it has been replaced there with better hybrids of the group mainly 5 BB and 5 C.  Cosmo in 1931 selected from Teleki's 8 B his 'Teleki-Cosmo 10', and Ferrari in 1921 his 'Teleki-Ferrari'",1017531,DVIT 2001,Vitis,,,Vitis hybr.,Vitis hybr.

The leaves of the vines are regarded by the local natives as having healing powers. [...] I was able to import them to California by courtesy of Dr. Austin Goheen of University of California at Davis, who managed their quarantine facility. A vine called Moschata Paradisa found at Mudgee NSW, [Australia] had the same ampelographic characters. [...] Some plants of the same vine as that dropped off at Futuna. Some were probably taken ashore, and planted among the vines of Busby's European collection at a location in what is now Sydney Botanical Gardens. And presumably from there they made their way to ""Kirkton,"" north in the Hunter Valley, thence to Mudgee. [...] While the parentage of the ""saints vine"" is unknown, I think a fair guess can be made as to its origin. Seeds from Spain of the sixteenth century would have Spanish varieties as parents. These seeds were planted in the Spanish colonies of north and south America, and became widespread. This is similar to the origin of the Mission vine of California. Cuttings of the ""saints vine"" were likely taken aboard the ""Europe"" by the French missionaries in the Chilean winter of 1837, and dropped off with Father Chanel on Futuna in November of that year.""",1018051,DVIT 2076,Vitis,,,Vitis vinifera,Vitis vinifera

Ravat blanc is a HDP that must be grafted, is as sensitive to powdery mildew as Carignane, and is very susceptible to bunch rot.

Roots: Large, little fibrous, rather fleshy, but very firm, deeply penetrating.  Wood: When young, cylindrical, whitish or brownish tomentose, soon becoming floccose and disappearing in the mature annual wood, which is a dark reddish-brown and often having numerous short, black glandular prickles, especially near the nodes, [...] buds large, globular, conical or obscurely triangular, acute, covered with shining reddish-brown scales, underneath which is an abundance of brownish-red wool, in expanding medium size, open, rosy or crimson; tendrils intermittent, rarely 3 to 5 in succession, ordinarily once forked in var. glauca, twice in the typical forms, long, slightly cottony in glauca, or rarely smooth when young, to densely rusty woolly in the species, at first finely striated, color reddish or green, becoming same color at wood at maturity, strong, persistant; internodes usually short, or of medium length, 2' to 4' or more; pith medium, slightly enlarged at lower end near diaphragm, pale brown.  Leaves: Stipules short 1/16' to 1/8 long, broad, pinkish, with thin rusty cotton on outer face; petiole in full grown leaf large and strong, average length 5', cylindrical or slightly flattened, with a very narrow, shallow groove above scarcely noticable, being hidden by pubescence or tomentum along its margins, striations obscure, with thick, velvety pubescence or tomentum, or both, along the striae, color purplish or pale red; blade large in the species to very large in var. glauca, 4' to 8', often more, broad, average width of many leaves 6'; blade always broader than long, generally twice or more the length of petiole; general outline circular; basal sinus generally broadly or narrowly A shaped with double curved sides, sometimes rounded, with limbs 3 to 5, sometimes 7 lobed; [...]  Cluster: Fertile,--varying from below medium in a large 3' to 10' or more long, in b, generally cylindrical with a large shoulder and very compact, generally simple and rather open, in a, rarely so in b ; divisions simple; peduncle medium or short; rachis cottony or nearly smooth, bluish-green when young; pedicels 1/6' to 1/4'  long, enlarged at summit, warty; sterile,--much larger and more compound.  Flowers:  Fertile,--tip of buds before opening, crimson, stamens weak, recurved and bending laterally close to base of the large ovary; seldom self-fertile; style short, thick; stigma large to medium, sometimes resembling (in form a), V. candicans, and (in form b), V. cinerea.  Staminate,--bud same as fertile, stamens strong, ascending.  Berries:  1/2' to 1' in diameter, in 'a' generally much larger than in 'b', often more or less oblate in 'a'; spherical in 'b'; color black or sometimes dark purple, covered with a thin bloom in 'a', more in 'b'; in a commonly drops very easily,--as soon as ripe,--'b' hangs much better and occasionally is quite persistant; skin thin and tough in 'b'; pulp in a usually tough, dry, very acid, and astringent; in 'b' more juicy, tender, sometimes quite melting, vinous.  Seeds:  1 to 4, small in 'b' generally, to very large in 'a', 1/5' to 1/4' or more long, by 1/6' to 1/5' broad, obvate pyriform, with sometimes very short or on beak, but genrerally with a large, orange colored, strong, blunt beak, sometimes in form 'b' small and acute, well defined, resembling V. cinerea; color light in a to dark purplish-brown in 'b'. [...] [APTITUDES]Vigor and endurance in the changeable western climates remarkable, resisting drought exceedingly well; Mildew and Rot attack leaves and fruit of some of the vines in regions where these fungi are abundant.""",1018851,DVIT 2202,Vitis,Var.,linsecomii,Vitis aestivalis,Vitis aestivalis var. linsecomii

Per Galet (see citation): [about V. cinerea Engelmann] ""Growing tip: felty white with rose margin, ashlike appearance, flat; stipules brownish-green. Young leaves: downy, gray with rose margin on upper surface, felty white below. Leaf: cordiform, medium in Montpellier, but large in some places in the United States (28 by 23 cm), 357-5-35 to 58, usually entire, rarely five-lobed (V. cinerea canesceans), soft, very bullate, dull, ash-gray, cobwebby-pubescent on both sides; small, nearly flat teeth; petiolar sinus lyre-shaped open or closed depending on the type; petioles downy-pubescent. Shoot: ash-gray, downy-pubescent, ribbed, thin. Flower cluster: very small, male or female. Cluster: conical, loose, medium-large, winged; berries round, black, small, thick skin, very little juice, acid flavor. Seeds: medium, 5 mm, chestnut colored, shiny with clear yellow beak and indentations; chalaza circular, .49, in small depression encircled with a few rediating lines, very short beak, protuberant raphe. Growth habit: very vigorous, climbing. [ ... ] V. cinerea has several common names: Parra silvestre (in Mexico), Ashy-leaved grape, Sweet winter, Downy, Ashy, Gray black, and Wichita grape. In the past confused with aestivalis, cinerea was officially named a distinct species in 1883 by George Engelmann.  [ ... ] Cinerea has a good resistance to phylloxera and the leaves do not carry the galls. However, it is chlorotic in limy soils and is extremely difficult to root, which rules out its usefulness as a rootstock.  The maturity of the wood is often deficient at the time of the first frost owing to its late ripening.  The resistance to fungus diseases is excellent, downy mildew, and black rot in particular. At present, the only cultivated descendants of cinerea are Black Spanish and Herbemont (aestivalis-cinerea-vinifera).""",1018987,DVIT 2223,Vitis,,,Vitis sp.,Vitis sp.

Shoots rather slender; internodes long, slightly angular, usually glabrous, sometimes slightly pubescent; diaphragms thick; tendrils intermittent, long, usually bifid.  Leaves with short, broad stipules; leaf-blade medium to large, cordate, entire or sometimes indistinctly three-lobed; petiolar sinus deep, usually narrow, acute; margin with rather course angular teeth; point of leaf acuminate; upper surface rather light green, glossy, glabrous; glabrous or sparingly pubescent below.  Clusters medium to large, loose, with long peduncle.  Berries numerous and small, black, shining, little or no bloom.  Seeds medium in size, rather broad, beak rather short; chalaza oval or roundish, elevated, very distinct; raphe a distinct, cord-like ridge.  Fruit usually sour and astringent and frequently consisting of little besides skins and seeds.  Leafing, flowering and ripening fruit very late.  Owing to the fact that Cordifolia and Riparia have been badly confused in the past, the limits of the habitat of this species are difficult to determine.  Pursh gives the northern limit as Canada, and Buckley speaks of its being found at Lake Winnipeg, but all other, and some probably better informed, authorities give the northern limit as New York or the Great Lakes.  The eastern limit is the Atlantic Ocean and the southern limit the Gulf of Mexico.  It extends westward, according to Engelmann, to the western limits of the wooded portion of the Mississippi Valley in the North, and, according to Munson, to the Brazos River, Texas, in the South.  It is found along creeks and river banks sometimes mixed with Riparia, having about the same soil adaptations as that species.  It is a very common species in the Middle States and is frequently found growing on limestone soils but, according to Viala, is not indigenous to such soils. [...] Cordifolia makes a good stock for grafting, being vigorous and forming a good union with most of our cultivatesd grapes.  It is seldom used for this purpose, however, on account of the difficulty of propagating it by means of cuttings.  For the same reason vines of it are seldom found in cultivation.  It is probably of no importance horticulturally.""",1019194,DVIT 2253,Vitis,,,Vitis vulpina,Vitis vulpina

Roots: Large, little fibrous, pale yellow, covered with thick, firm warty bark, transversely wrinkled, possessing a fiery pungency, penetrating. Wood: When young 6 to 7 angled, dark red or crimson, nearly smooth or thinly set with silky hairs, with age becoming covered with numerous minute punctate dots or lenticose cells, like warts set in rows on the fine unequal striae, becoming more distinct and increasing with age till the vine has a rasp-like feeling as though covered with coarse sand, and acquiring a dark gray color; bark with little checking, no thready fiber, closely persistant; transverse section of ripe wood oval, with age becoming elliptical or even depressed elliptical, dense but less so than V. rotundifolia; [...] Leaves: Stipules very small, 1/12' long, orbicular, margin ciliate, pale pinkish; petiole usually as long as half the width of blade, sometimes more, more slender than in V. rotundifolia and proportionately shorter, deeply and distinctly grooved above, finely pubescent, purplish crimson, attached to blade at right or more acute angle; [...] Cluster: Forked, cyme-like, from the node of the tendril; divisions obscurely striated, warty, pale rusty brown when mature; pedicels 1/4' to 1/3' long, medium thick, little enlarged upward, warty.  Flowers: 12 to 50 in fertile clusters; stamens and petals usually 5, often 6 and sometimes 7; in fertile, stamens about 1/12' long, recurved and bent laterally, little or no perceptible disc; ovary small, broad and short; style very short, about half the thickness of ovary, in length; stigma very small, semi-globose, nearly sessile,--stamens long, straight, ascending at an angle of 45 [degrees] to 50 [degrees] from axis of receptacle extended.

Seeds: 3 to 4 in each berry, small, 1/6' to 1/5' long by 1/10' to 1/16' broad, being not more than 1/4 or 1/5 as large in bulk on the average as in V. rotundifolia, sides often unequal, surface glossy, dark greenish-brown coffee color, much darker than in V. rotundifolia, beak very small, short, acute, or none; raphe plainly or obscurely visible but not prominent within the notch at top of seed till it reaches the inner face, there hair-like; [...] Vigorous but slender, more upright when young than V. rotundifolia, which is less branched and more sprawling in young vines, but becomes much more drooping, or weeping or trellis than V. rotundifolia, the lateral branches very slender, almost filiform.  The ever-blooming character of this species, with its smaller seeds, larger clusters, more vinous and acid than V. rotundifolia, and its freedom from disease, may render it an excellent material with which to hybridize the finer V. vinifera, varieties to secure valuable grapes for the extreme south and and the tropics.
